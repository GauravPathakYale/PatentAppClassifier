Description


FIELD OF THE INVENTION

This invention relates to pharmaceutically useful prodrugs of pharmaceutically active compounds, which active compounds are, in particular, competitive inhibitors of trypsin-like serine proteases, especially thrombin, the use of the prodrugs as medicaments, pharmaceutical compositions containing them and synthetic routes to their production.

BACKGROUND

Blood coagulation is the key process involved in both haemostatis (ie the prevention of blood loss from a damaged vessel) and thrombosis (ie the formation of a blood clot in a blood vessel, sometimes leading to vessel obstruction).

Coagulation is the result of a complex series of enzymatic reactions. One of the ultimate steps in this series of reactions is the conversion of the proenzyme prothrombin to the active enzyme thrombin.

Thrombin is known to play a central role in coagulation. It activates platelets, leading to platelet aggregation, converts fibrinogen into fibrin monomers, which polymerise spontaneously into fibrin polymers, and activates factor XIII, which in turn crosslinks the polymers to form insoluble fibrin. Furthermore, thrombin activates factor V and factor VIII leading to a "positive feedback" generation of thrombin from prothrombin.

By inhibiting the aggregation of platelets and the formation and crosslinking of fibrin, effective inhibitors of thrombin would therefore be expected to exhibit antithrombotic activity. In addition, antithrombotic activity would be expected to be enhanced by effective inhibition of the positive feedback mechanism.

PRIOR ART

The development of low molecular weight inhibitors of thrombin has been described by Claesson in Blood Coagul. Fibrin. (1994) 5, 411.

Blomback et al (in J. Clin. Lab. Invest. 24, suppl. 107, 59, (1969)) reported thrombin inhibitors based on the amino acid sequences situated around the cleavage site for the fibrinogen A.alpha. chain. Of the amino acid sequences discussed, these authors suggested the tripeptide sequence Phe--Val--Arg would be the most effective inhibitor.

Low molecular weight peptide-based thrombin inhibitors have subsequently been disclosed in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,346,078; International Patent Applications WO 93/11152, WO 94/29336, WO 93/18060 and WO 95/01168; and European Patent Applications 648 780, 468 231, 559 046, 641 779, 185 390, 526 877, 542 525, 195 212, 362 002, 364 344, 530 167, 293 881, 686 642 and 601 459.

More recently, thrombin inhibitors based on peptide derivatives have been disclosed in European Patent Application 0 669 317 and International Patent Applications WO 95/23609, WO 95/35309, WO 96/25426 and WO 94/29336.

In particular, the latter application discloses the peptide derivatives R.sup.a OOC--CH.sub.2 --(R)Cgl--Aze--Pab--H, wherein R.sup.a represents H, benzyl or C.sub.1-6 alkyl.

Although these active compounds are known to exhibit significant antithrombin activity, it would be beneficial to improve their pharmacokinetic properties both after oral and parenteral administration. Examples of pharmacokinetic properties which it is desirable to improve include:

(a) providing an improved absorption from the gastro-intestinal tract, with a view to reducing intra- and/or inter-individual variability in relation to the bioavailability of the active compounds;

(b) flattening the plasma concentration time profit (ie reducing the peak/trough ratio in the plasma concentration over the dosing interval), with a view to reducing the risk of falling outside the therapeutic interval and the side effects caused by a concentration peak which is too high (eg bleeding), and those caused by one which is too low (eg thrombus formation); and

(c) increasing the duration of action of the active compounds.

Moreover, oral and parenteral administration of active thrombin inhibitors may lead to undesirable local bleeding (eg in the intestinal lumen or subcutaneously) as a result of a high local concentrations.

Finally, orally administered active thrombin inhibitors which also inhibit trypsin and other serine proteases in the gastrointestinal tract may exhibit additional side effects, including indigestion (eg if trypsin is inhibited in the intestinal lumen).

Although certain N-benzyloxycarbonyl derivatives of the aforementioned active compounds are also disclosed as thrombin inhibitors in International Patent Application WO 94/29336, that these derivatives may be useful as prodrugs is not mentioned. In fact, WO 94/29336 makes no mention of suitable prodrugs of the active compounds.

We have found that the above problems may be solved by administering compounds according to the present invention which, whilst inactive per se, upon oral and/or parenteral administration are metabolised in the body to form active thrombin inhibitors, including those mentioned above.

Medical and pharmaceutical use

The compounds of the invention are useful because they are metabolised in the body to form compounds which possess pharmacological activity. They are therefore indicated as pharmaceuticals and in particular as prodrugs.

In particular, the compounds of the invention, although they are inactive to thrombin per se, are metabolised in the body to form potent inhibitors of thrombin, for example as demonstrated in the test described below.

By "the compounds of the invention are inactive to thrombin per se" we mean that they exhibit an IC.sub.50 TT value, as determined in Test A below, of greater than 1 .mu.M.

The compounds of the invention are thus expected to be useful in those conditions where inhibition of thrombin is required.

The compounds of the invention are thus indicated both in the therapeutic and/or prophylactic treatment of thrombosis and hypercoagulability in blood and tissues of animals including man.

It is known that hypercoagulability may lead to thrombo-embolic diseases.

Thrombo-embolic diseases which may be mentioned include activated protein C resistance, such as the factor V-mutation (factor V Leiden), and inherited or acquired deficiencies in antithrombin III, protein C, protein S, heparin cofactor II. Other conditions known to be associated with hypercoagulability and thromo-embolic disease include circulating antiphospholipid antibodies (Lupus anticoagulant), homocysteinemi, heparin induced thrombocytopenia and defects in fibrinolysis. The compounds of the invention are thus indicated both in the therapeutic and/or prophylactic treatment of these conditions.

The compounds of the invention are further indicated in the treatment of conditions where there is an undesirable excess of thrombin without signs of hypercoagulability, for example in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.

Particular disease states which may be mentioned include the therapeutic and/or prophylactic treatment of venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, arterial thrombosis (eg in myocardial infarction, unstable angina, thrombosis-based stroke and peripheral arterial thrombosis) and systemic embolism usually from the atrium during arterial fibrillation or from the left ventricle after transmural myocardial infarction.

Moreover, the compounds of the invention are expected to have utility in prophylaxis of re-occlusion (ie thrombosis) after thrombolysis, percutaneous trans-luminal angioplasty (PTA) and coronary bypass operations; the prevention of re-thrombosis after microsurgery and vascular surgery in general.

Further indications include the therapeutic and/or prophylactic treatment of disseminated intravascular coagulation caused by bacteria, multiple trauma, intoxication or any other mechanism; anticoagulant treatment when blood is in contact with foreign surfaces in the body such as vascular grafts, vascular stents, vascular catheters, mechanical and biological prosthetic valves or any other medical device; and anticoagulant treatment when blood is in contact with medical devices outside the body such as during cardiovascular surgery using a heat-lung machine or in haemodialysis.

In addition to its effects on the coagulation process, thrombin is known to activate a large number of cells (such as neutrophils, fibroblasts, endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells). Therefore, the compounds of the invention may also be useful for the therapeutic and/or prophylactic treatment of idiopathic and adult respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonary fibrosis following treatment with radiation or chemotherapy, septic shock, septicemia, inflammatory responses, which include, but are not limited to, edema, acute or chronic atherosclerosis such as coronary arterial disease, cerebral arterial disease, peripheral arterial disease, reperfusion damage, and restenosis after percutaneous trans-luminal angioplasty (PTA).

Compounds of the invention that inhibit trypsin and/or thrombin may also be useful in the treatment of pancreatitis.

According to a further aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of treatment of a condition where inhibition of thrombin is required which method comprises administration of a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula I as defined above, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, to a person suffering from, or susceptible to such a condition.

The compounds of the invention will normally be administered orally, buccally, rectally, dermally, nasally, tracheally, bronchially, by any other parenteral route or via inhalation, in the form of pharmaceutical preparations comprising the prodrug either as a free base, or a pharmaceutical acceptable non-toxic organic or inorganic acid addition salt, in a pharmaceutically acceptable dosage form. Depending upon the disorder and patient to be treated an the route of administration, the compositions may be administered at varying doses.

The compounds of the invention may also be combined and/or co-administered with any antithrombotic agent with a different mechanism of action, such as the antiplatelet agents acetylsalicylic acid, ticlopidine, clopidogrel, thromboxane receptor and/or synthetase inhibitors, fibrinogen receptor antagonists, prostacyclin mimetics and phosphodiesterase inhibitors and ADP-receptor (P.sub.2 T) antagonists.

The compounds of the invention may further be combined and/or co-administered with thrombolytics such as tissue plasminogen activator (natural or recombinant), streptokinase, urokinase, prourokinase, anisolated streptokinase plasminogen activator complex (ASPAC), animal salivary gland plasminogen activators, and the like, in the treatment of thrombotic diseases, in particular myocardial infarction.

According to a further aspect of the invention there is thus provided a pharmaceutical formulation including a compound of formula I as hereinbefore defined, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvant, diluent or carrier.

Suitable daily doses of the compounds of the invention in therapeutical treatment of humans are about 0.001-100 mg/kg body weight at peroral administration and 0.001-50 mg/kg body weight at parenteral administration.

The compounds of the invention have the advantage that they may have improved pharmacokinetic properties, such as those identified hereinbefore, both after oral and parenteral administration, when compared with compounds of formula:

wherein R.sup.a is as hereinbefore defined, and in particular the compound wherein R.sup.a represents H.

The compounds of the invention are inactive to thrombin, trypsin and other serine proteases. The compounds thus remain inactive in the gastrointestinal tract and the potential complications experienced by orally administered anticoagulants which are active per se, such as bleeding and indigestion resulting from inhibition of trypsin, may thus be avoided.

Furthermore, local bleeding associated with and after parenteral administration of an active thrombin inhibitor may be avoided by using the compounds of the invention.

The compounds of the invention may also have the advantage that they may be more efficacious than, be less toxic than, be longer acting than, have a broader range of activity than, produce fewer side effects than, be more easily absorbed than, or that they may have other useful pharmacological properties over, compounds known in the prior art.

BIOLOGICAL TESTS

Test A

Determination of Thrombin Clotting Time (TT)

Human thrombin (T 6769, Sigma Chem Co, final concentration of 1.4 NIH units/mL) in buffer solution, pH 7.4, 100 .mu.L, and inhibitor solution, 100 .mu.L, were incubated for one min. Pooled normal citrated human plasma, 100 .mu.L, was then added and the clotting time measured in an automatic device (KC 10, Amelung).

The clotting time in seconds was plotted against the inhibitor concentration, and the IC.sub.50 TT was determined by interpolation.

IC.sub.50 TT is the concentration of inhibitor that doubles the thrombin clotting time for human plasma.

Test B

Determination of Thrombin Time in Plasma Ex Vivo

The inhibition of thrombin after oral or parenteral administration of the compounds of the invention were examined in conscious rats which, one or two days prior to the experiment, were equipped with a catheter for blood sampling from the carotid artery. On the experimental day, the compound, dissolved in ethanol:Solutol.TM.: water (5:5:90), was administered and blood samples were withdrawn at fixed times into plastic tubes containing 1 part sodium citrate solution (0.13 mol per L.) and 9 parts of blood, The tubes were centrifuged to obtain platelet poor plasma. The plasma was used for determination of thrombin time as described below.

The citrated rat plasma, 100 .mu.L, was diluted with a saline solution, 0.9%, 100 .mu.L, and plasma coagulation was started by the addition of human thrombin (T 6769, Sigma Chem Co, USA) in a buffer solution, pH 7.4, 100 .mu.L. The clotting time was measured in an automatic device (KC 10, Amelumg, Germany).

The concentrations of the active thrombin inhibitor HO(O)C--CH.sub.2 (R)Cgl-Aze-Pab--H (see International Patent Application WO 94/29336) in the rat plasma were estimated by the use of standard curves relating the thrombin time in the pooled citrated rat plasma to known concentrations of the aforementioned active thrombin inhibitor dissolved in saline.

Based on the estimated plasma concentrations of the active thrombin inhibitor HO(O)C--CH.sub.2 (R)Cgl-Aze-Pab--H (which assumes that thrombin time prolongation is caused by the aforementioned compound) in the rat, the area under the curve after oral and/or parenteral administration of the prodrug was calculated (AUCpd) using the trapezoidal rule and extrapolation of data to infinity.

The bioavailability of the active thrombin inhibitor HO(O)C--CH.sub.2 (R)Cgl-Aze-Pab--H after oral or parenteral administration of the prodrug was calculated as below:

where AUCactive,iv represents the AUC obtained after intravenous administration of HO(O)C--CH.sub.2 (R)Cgl-Aze-Pab--H to conscious rats as described above.

Test C

Determination of Thrombin Time in Urine Ex Vivo

The amount of the active thrombin inhibitor HO(O)C--CH.sub.2 (R)Cgl-Aze-Pab--H that was excreted in urine after oral or parenteral administration of the compounds of the invention, dissolved in ethanol:solution.TM.:water (5:5:90), was estimated by determination of the thrombin time in urine ex vivo (assuming that thrombin time prolongation is caused by the aforementioned compound).

Conscious rats were placed in metabolish cages, allowing separate collection of urine and faeces, for 24 hours following oral administration of compounds of the invention. The thrombin time was determined on the collected urine as described below.

Pooled normal citrated human plasma (100 .mu.L) was incubated with the concentrated rat urine, or saline dilutions thereof, for one minute. Plasma coagulation was then initiated by the administration of human thrombin (T 6769, Sigma Chem Company) in buffer solution (pH 7.4; 100 .mu.L). The clotting time was measured in an automatic device (KC 10; Amelung).

The concentrations of the active thrombin inhibitor HO(O)C--CH.sub.2 (R)Cgl-Aze-Pab--H in the rat urine was estimated by the use of standard curves relating the thrombin time in the pooled normal citrated human plasma to known concentrations of the aforementioned active thrombin inhibitor dissolved in concentrated rat urine (or saline dilutions thereof). By multiplying the total rat urine production over the 24 hour period with the estimated mean concentration of the aforementioned active inhibitor in the urine, the amount of the active inhibitor excreted in the urine (AMOUNTpd) could be calculated.

The bioavailability of the active thrombin inhibitor HO(O)C--CH.sub.2 (R)Cgl-Aze-Pab--H after oral or parenteral administration of the prodrug was calculated as below:

where AMOUNTactive,iv represents the amount excreted in the urine after intravenous administration of HO(O)C--CH.sub.2 (R)Cgl-Aze-Pab--H to conscious rats as described above.

Test D

Determination of HO(O)C--CH.sub.2 --(R)Cgl-Aze-Pab--H in Urine by LC-MS

The amount of the active thrombin inhibitor HO(O)C--CH.sub.2 --(R)Cgl-Aze-Pab--H that was excreted in urine after oral or parenteral administration of the compounds of the invention, dissolved in ethanol:Solutol.TM.:water (5:5:90), was measured by LC-MS analysis as described below.

The animal studies were performed as described in Method C above. Urine samples were collected and frozen at -20.degree. C. before they were analysed.

Urine samples were analysed for their content of HO(O)C--CH.sub.2 --(R)Cgl-Aze-Pab--H according to the following method:

Thawed urine samples were mixed and, if required, spinned in a centrifuge. Solid phase extraction tubes (Analytichem Bond Elut. No. 1210-2059) were activated with 1.0 mL of methanol and conditioned with 1.0 mL of acetonitrile:water (50:50), followed by 1.0 mL of 0.1% formic acid. 50 .mu.L of the working internal standard (20 .mu.mol/L) was added to each extraction tube. For urine standards, 50 .mu.L of standard solution was added. 200 .mu.L of a sample or, for urine standards, blank urine was added to each tube and thereafter pulled through via gravity or a gentle vacuum. Residual urine was washed out with 1.0 mL of ammonium acetate (2 mmol/L), before elution with 1.0 mL of acetonitrile:ammonium acetate (1 mmol/L) (35:65). The collected eluate was transferred to autosampler vials. 30 .mu.L of the extract was injected onto the LC column (Hypersil BDS-C18; 3 .mu.m; 75 mm.times.4.0 mm i.d.; Hewlett-Packard No. 79926 03-354), eluted with ammonium acetate buffer (1.3 mmol/L) with 40% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid at 0.75 mL/min. The effluent was split so that 30 .mu.L/min entered the electrospray ion source of a P-E Sciex API-3 mass spectrometer. HO(O)C--CH.sub.2 --(R)Cgl-Aze-Pab--H and HO(O)C--CH.sub.2 --(R)Cgl-Pro-Pab--H (internal standard) both have retention times near 1.5 minutes. Their molecular ions ((M+H).sup.+) were monitored at m/z 430.2 and 444.2 respectively, at unit mass resolution. Urine standards at two levels, one being at the limit of quantification, were used for calibration based on peak area ratios of HO(O)C--CH.sub.2 --(R)Cgl-Aze-Pab--H over the internal standard. Linearity of the method was checked over the range 0.050-20 .mu.mol/L. The coefficient of variation was 1-2% at 1-20 .mu.mol/L and 7% at 0.50 .mu.mol/L. The limit of quantification was 0.050 .mu.mol/L.

By multiplying the total urine production over the 214 hour period by the measured concentration of HO(O)C--CH.sub.2 --(R)Cgl-Aze-Pab--H in the urine, the amount of the active inhibitor excreted in urine (AMOUNTpd) could be calculated. The bioavailability of the active thrombin inhibitor was then calculated as described in Method C above.

The invention is illustrated by way of the following example.
