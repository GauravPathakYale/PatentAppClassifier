C. for 45 min. Samples were then transferred on to GF/B filters using a cell harvester and washed with wash buffer (50 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 5 mM MgCl.sub.2, 50 mM NaCl). Filters were then covered with scintilant and counted for the amount of [.sup.35S]-GTP.gamma.S retained by the filter.

[0152] Activity is measured in the absence of all ligands (minimum activity) or in the presence of an EC80 concentration of CP55940 (maximum activity). These activities are set as 0% and 100% activity respectively. At various concentrations of novel ligand, activity is calculated as a percentage of the maximum activity and plotted. The data are fitted using the equation y=A+((B-A)/1+((C/x) UD)) and the IC50 value determined as the concentration required to give half maximal inhibition of GTP.gamma.S binding under the conditions used.

[0153] The compounds of the present invention are active at the CBI receptor (IC50<1 micromolar). Most preferred compounds have IC50<200 nanomolar. For example the IC50 of Example 10 is 6.0 nM and Example 11 is 6.4 nM.

[0154] The compounds of the invention are believed to be selective CB1 antagonists or inverse agonists. The potency, selectivity profile and side effect propensity may limit the clinical usefulness of hitherto known compounds with alleged CB1 antagonistic/inverse agonistic properties. In this regard, preclinical evaluation of compounds of the present invention in models of gastrointestinal and/or cardiovascular function indicates that they offer significant advantages compared to representative reference CB1 antagonist/inverse agonist agents.

[0155] The compounds of the present invention may provide additional benefits in terms of potency, selectivity profile, bioavailability, half-life in plasma, blood brain permeability, plasma protein binding (for example higher free fraction of drug) or solubility compared to representative reference CB1 antagonists/inverse agonist agents.

[0156] The utility of the compounds of the present invention in the treatment of obesity and related conditions is demonstrated by a decrease in body weight in cafeteria diet-induced obese mice. Female C57B1/6J mice were given ad libitum access to calorie-dense `cafeteria` diet (soft chocolate/cocoa-type pastry, chocolate, fatty cheese and nougat) and standard lab chow for 8-10 weeks. Compounds to be tested were then administered systemically (iv, ip, sc or po) once daily for a minimum of 5 days, and the body weights of the mice monitored on a daily basis. Simultaneous assessment of adiposity was carried by means of DEXA imaging at baseline and termination of the study. Blood sampling was also carried out to assay changes in obesity-related plasma markers.

General Experimental Procedures

[0181] Mass spectra were recorded on either a Micromass ZQ single quadrupole or a Micromass LCZ single quadrupole mass spectrometer both equipped with a pneumatically assisted electrospray interface (LC-MS). .sup.1H NMR measurements were performed on either a Varian Mercury 300 or a Varian Inova 500, operating at .sup.1H frequencies of 300 and 500 MHz respectively. Chemical shifts are given in ppm with CDCl.sub.3 as internal standard. CDCl.sub.3 is used as the solvent for NMR unless otherwise stated. Purification was performed on a semipreparative HPLC with a mass triggered fraction collector, Shimadzu QP 8000 single quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with 19.times.100 mm C8 column. The mobile phase used was, if nothing else is stated, acetonitrile and buffer (0.1 M NH.sub.4Ac:acetonitrile 95:5).

[0182] For isolation of isomers, a Kromasil CN E9344 (250.times.20 mm i.d.) column was used. Heptane:ethyl acetate:DEA 95:5:0.1 was used as mobile phase (1 ml/min). Fraction collection was guided using a UV-detector (330 nm).

[0209] .sup.1H NMR (CDCl.sub.3): .delta. 7.46 (2H, d), 7.31 (2H, m), 7.12-7.04 (4H, m), 4.34 (2H, q), 2.43 (3H, s), 1.39 (3H, t), 0.28 (9H, s) MS m/z 469 (M+Na)

Step D. 5 -(2,4-Dichloro-phenyl)-2-methyl-1-(4-trimethylsilanyl-phenyl)-1H- -pyrrole-3-carboxylic acid piperidin-1-ylamide

[0210] To a solution of aminopiperidine (133 .mu.l, 1.23 mmol) in dry chloroform (2 ml), was added dropwise under nitrogen a solution of trimethylaluminum in toluene (613 .mu.l, 2 M sol., 1.23 mmol). The mixture was kept at r.t. with stirring for an additional 1 h. 5-(2,4-Dichloro-phenyl)-2-methyl-1-(4-trimethylsilanyl-phenyl)-1H-pyrrole- -3-carboxylic acid ethyl ester (217 mg, 0.49 mmol) dissolved in dry chloroform (1 ml) was then added and the solution was warmed to 45.degree. C. and stirred for 19 hours under nitrogen. The reaction mixture was poured carefully into 10 ml of 2 M HCl and the resultant mixture was stirred at 40 .degree. C. for 30 min. The layers were separated and the aqueous layer was extracted with chloroform (2.times.15 ml). The combined organic layers were washed with brine, dried (Na.sub.2SO.sub.4) and concentrated under reduced pressure. Flash-chromatography (silica, hexane:EtOAc 80:20) afforded 36 mg (16%) of the title compound as a white solid.

[0211] .sup.1H NMR (CDCl.sub.3): .delta. 7.47 (2H, d), 7.33 (2H, d), 7.08-7.00 (4H, m), 2.92 (4H, m), 2.45 (3H, s), 1.77 (4H, m), 1.48 (2H, m), 0.29 (9H, s) MS m/z 523 (M+Na) HPLC: 92.4%.
