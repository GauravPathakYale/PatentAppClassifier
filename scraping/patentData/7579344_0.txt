Description


This application is a 371 of PCT/GB04/02019 filed May 12, 2004.

The invention relates to pyrimidine derivatives, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts or in vivo hydrolysable esters thereof, which possess cell-cycle inhibitory activity and are accordingly useful for their anti-cell-proliferation (such as anti-cancer) activity and are therefore useful in methods of treatment of the human or animal body. The invention also relates to processes for the manufacture of said pyrimidine derivatives, to pharmaceutical compositions containing them and to their use in the manufacture of medicaments of use in the production of an anti-cell-proliferation effect in a warm-blooded animal such as man.

The cell cycle is fundamental to the survival, regulation and proliferation of cells and is highly regulated to ensure that each step progresses in a timely and orderly manner. The progression of cells through the cell cycle arises from the sequential activation and de-activation of several members of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) family. The activation of CDKs is dependent on their interaction with a family of intracellular proteins called cyclins Cyclins bind to CDKs and this association is essential for CDK (such as CDK1, CDK2, CDK4 and/or CDK6) activity within the cell. Different cyclins are expressed and degraded at different points in the cell cycle to ensure that activation and inactivation of CDKs occurs in the correct order for progression through the cell cycle.

Moreover, CDKs appear to be downstream of a number of oncogene signalling pathways. Disregulation of CDK activity by upregulation of cyclins and/or deletion of endogenous inhibitors appears to be an important axis between mitogenic signalling pathways and proliferation of tumour cells.

Accordingly it has been recognised that an inhibitor of cell cycle kinases, particularly inhibitors of CDK1, CDK2 and/or CDK4 (which operate at the G2/M, G1-S-G2/M and G1-S phase respectively) should be of value as a selective inhibitor of cell proliferation, such as growth of mammalian cancer cells.

WO 02/20512, WO 03/076435, WO 03/076436, WO 03/076434 and WO 03/076433 describe certain 2-anilino-4-imidazolylpyrimidine derivatives that inhibit the effect of cell cycle kinases. The present invention is based on the discovery that a novel group of 2-anilino-4-bicyclicpyrimidines surprisingly inhibit the effects of cell cycle kinases showing selectivity for CDK1, CDK2and CDK3, and thus possess anti-cell-proliferation properties.

A suitable protecting group for an amino or alkylamino group is, for example, an acyl group, for example an alkanoyl group such as acetyl, an alkoxycarbonyl group, for example a methoxycarbonyl, ethoxycarbonyl or t-butoxycarbonyl group, an arylmethoxycarbonyl group, for example benzyloxycarbonyl, or an aroyl group, for example benzoyl. The deprotection conditions for the above protecting groups necessarily vary with the choice of protecting group. Thus, for example, an acyl group such as an alkanoyl or alkoxycarbonyl group or an aroyl group may be removed for example, by hydrolysis with a suitable base such as an alkali metal hydroxide, for example lithium or sodium hydroxide. Alternatively an acyl group such as a t-butoxycarbonyl group may be removed, for example, by treatment with a suitable acid as hydrochloric, sulphuric or phosphoric acid or trifluoroacetic acid and an arylmethoxycarbonyl group such as a benzyloxycarbonyl group may be removed, for example, by hydrogenation over a catalyst such as palladium-on-carbon, or by treatment with a Lewis acid for example boron tris(trifiuoroacetate). A suitable alternative protecting group for a primary amino group is, for example, a phthaloyl group which may be removed by treatment with an alkylamine, for example dimethylaminopropylamine, or with hydrazine.

A suitable protecting group for a hydroxy group is, for example, an acyl group, for example an alkanoyl group such as acetyl, an aroyl group, for example benzoyl, or an arylmethyl group, for example benzyl. The deprotection conditions for the above protecting groups will necessarily vary with the choice of protecting group. Thus, for example, an acyl group such as an alkanoyl or an aroyl group may be removed, for example, by hydrolysis with a suitable base such as an alkali metal hydroxide, for example lithium or sodium hydroxide. Alternatively an arylmethyl group such as a benzyl group may be removed, for example, by hydrogenation over a catalyst such as palladium-on-carbon.

A suitable protecting group for a carboxy group is, for example, an esterifying group, for example a methyl or an ethyl group which may be removed, for example, by hydrolysis with a base such as sodium hydroxide, or for example a t-butyl group which may be removed, for example, by treatment with an acid, for example an organic acid such as trifluoroacetic acid, or for example a benzyl group which may be removed, for example, by hydrogenation over a catalyst such as palladium-on-carbon.

The protecting groups may be removed at any convenient stage in the synthesis using conventional techniques well known in the chemical art.

As stated hereinbefore the compounds defined in the present invention possesses anti-cell-proliferation activity such as anti-cancer activity which is believed to arise from the CDK inhibitory activity of the compound. These properties may be assessed, for example, using the procedure set out below:

Assay

The following abbreviations have been used: HEPES is N-[2-Hydroxyethyl]piperazine-N-[2-ethanesulfonic acid] DTT is Dithiothreitol PMSF is Phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride

The compounds were tested in an in vitro kinase assay in 96 well format using Scintillation Proximity Assay (SPA - obtained from Amersham) for measuring incorporation of [.gamma.-33-P]-Adenosine Triphosphate into a test substrate (GST-Retinoblastoma protein; GST-Rb). In each well was placed the compound to be tested (diluted in DMSO and water to correct concentrations) and in control wells either roscovitine as an inhibitor control or DMSO as a positive control.

Approximately 0.2 .mu.l of CDK2/Cyclin E partially-purified enzyme (amount dependent on enzyme activity) diluted in 25 .mu.l incubation buffer was added to each well then 20 .mu.l of GST-Rb/ATP/ATP33 mixture (containing 0.5 .mu.g GST-Rb and 0.2 .mu.M ATP and 0.14 .mu.Ci [.gamma.-33-P]-Adenosine Triphosphate in incubation buffer), and the resulting mixture shaken gently, then incubated at room temperature for 60 minutes.

To each well was then added 150 .mu.L stop solution containing (0.8 mg/well of Protein A-PVT SPA bead (Amersham)), 20 pM/well of Anti-Glutathione Transferase, Rabbit IgG (obtained from Molecular Probes), 61 mM EDTA and 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5 containing 0.05% sodium azide.

The plates were sealed with Topseal-S plate sealers, left for two hours then spun at 2500 rpm, 1124 xg., for 5 minutes. The plates were read on a Topcount for 30 seconds per well.

The incubation buffer used to dilute the enzyme and substrate mixes contained 50 mM HEPES pH7.5, 10 mM MnCl.sub.2, 1 mM DTT, 100 .mu.M Sodium vanadate, 100 .mu.M NaF, 10 mM Sodium Glycerophosphate, BSA (1 mg/ml final).

Test Substrate

In this assay only part of the retinoblastoma protein (Science 1987 Mar. 13;235(4794):1394-1399; Lee W. H., Bookstein R., Hong F., Young L. J., Shew J. Y., Lee E. Y.) was used, fused to a GST tag. PCR of retinoblastoma gene encoding amino acids 379-928 (obtained from retinoblastoma plasmid ATCC pLRbRNL) was performed, and the sequence cloned into pGEx 2T fusion vector (Smith D. B. and Johnson, K. S. Gene 67, 31 (1988); which contained a tac promoter for inducible expression, internal lac I.sup.q gene for use in any E. Coli host, and a coding region for thrombin cleavage--obtained from Pharmacia Biotech) which was used to amplify amino acids 792-928. This sequence was again cloned into pGEx 2T.

The retinoblastoma 792-928 sequence so obtained was expressed in E. Coli (BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells) using standard inducible expression techniques, and purified as follows.

E. coli paste was resuspended in 10 ml/g of NETN buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 120 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% v/v NP-40, 1 mM PMSF, 1ug/ml leupeptin, 1ug/ml aprotinin and 1 ug/ml pepstatin) and sonicated for 2.times.45 seconds per 100 ml homogenate. After centrifugation, the supernatant was loaded onto a 10 ml glutathione Sepharose column (Pharmacia Biotech, Herts, UK), and washed with NETN buffer. After washing with kinase buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 10 mM MgC12, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, 1 ug/ml leupeptin, 1 ug/ml aprotinin and 1 ug/ml pepstatin) the protein was eluted with 50 mM reduced glutathione in kinase buffer. Fractions containing GST-Rb(792-927) were pooled and dialysed overnight against kinase buffer. The final product was analysed by Sodium Dodeca Sulfate (SDS) PAGE (Polyacrylamide gel) using 8-16% Tris-Glycine gels (Novex, San Diego, USA).

CDK2 and Cyclin E

The open reading frames of CDK2 and Cyclin E were isolated by reverse transcriptase-PCR using HeLa cell and activated T cell mRNA as a template and cloned into the insect expression vector pVL1393 (obtained from Invitrogen 1995 catalogue number: V1392-20). CDK2 and cyclin E were then dually expressed [using a standard virus Baculogold co-infection technique] in the insect SF21 cell system (Spodoptera Frugiperda cells derived from ovarian tissue of the Fall Army Worm--commercially available).

Example Production of Cyclin E/CDK2

The following Example provides details of the production of Cyclin E/CDK2 in SF21 cells (in TC100+10% FBS(TCS)+0.2% Pluronic) having dual infection MOI 3 for each virus of Cyclin E & CDK2.

SF21 cells grown in aroller bottle culture to 2.33.times.10.sup.6 cells/ml were used to inoculate 10.times.500 ml roller bottles at 0.2.times.10E6 cells/ml. The roller bottles were incubated on a roller rig at 28.degree. C.

After 3 days (72 hrs.) the cells were counted, and the average from 2 bottles found to be 1.86.times.10E6 cells/ml. (99% viable). The cultures were then infected with the dual viruses at an MOI 3 for each virus.

The viruses were mixed together before addition to the cultures, and the cultures returned to the roller rig 28.degree. C.

After 2 days (48 hrs.) post infection the 5 Litres of culture was harvested. The total cell count at harvest was 1.58.times.10E6 cells/ml.(99% viable). The cells were spun out at 2500 rpm, 30 mins., 4.degree. C. in Heraeus Omnifuge 2.0 RS in 250 ml. lots. The supernatant was discarded.

Partial Co-Purification of Cdk2 and Cyclin E

Sf21 cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8.2, 10 mM MgCl.sub.2, 1 mM DTT, 10 mM glycerophosphate, 0.1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 0.1 mM NaF, 1 mM PMSF, 1 ug/ml leupeptin and 1 ug/ml aprotinin) and homogenised for 2 minutes in a 10 ml Dounce homgeniser. After centrifugation, the supernatant was loaded onto a Poros HQ/M 1.4/100 anion exchange column (PE Biosystems, Hertford, UK). Cdk2 and Cyclin E were coeluted at the beginning of a 0-1M NaCl gradient (run in lysis buffer minus protease inhibitors) over 20 column volumes. Co-elution was checked by western blot using both anti-Cdk2 and anti-Cyclin E antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Calif., US).

By analogy, assays designed to assess inhibition of CDK1 and CDK4 may be constructed. CDK2 (EMBL Accession No. X62071) may be used together with Cyclin A or Cyclin E (see EMBL Accession No. M73812), and further details for such assays are contained in PCT International Publication No. WO99/21845, the relevant Biochemical & Biological Evaluation sections of which are hereby incorporated by reference.

Although the pharmacological properties of the compounds of the formula (I) vary with structural change, in general activity possessed by compounds of the formula (I) may be demonstrated at IC.sub.50 concentrations or doses in the range 250 .mu.M to 1 nM.

The following IC.sub.50s were measured in the above assay.

TABLE-US-00001 Example No IC.sub.50 2 21 nM 5 42 nM 9 13 nM

The in vivo activity of the compounds of the present invention may be assessed by standard techniques, for example by measuring inhibition of cell growth and assessing cytotoxicity.

Inhibition of cell growth may be measured by staining cells with Sulforhodamine B (SRB), a fluorescent dye that stains proteins and therefore gives an estimation of amount of protein (i.e. cells) in a well (see Boyd, M. R.(1989) Status of the NCI preclinical antitumour drug discovery screen. Prin. Prac Oncol 10:1-12). Thus, the following details are provided of measuring inhibition of cell growth:--

Cells were plated in appropriate medium in a volume of 100 .mu.l in 96 well plates; media was Dulbecco's Modified Eagle media for MCF-7, SK-UT-1B and SK-UT-1. The cells were allowed to attach overnight, then inhibitor compounds were added at various concentrations in a maximum concentration of 1% DMSO (v/v). A control plate was assayed to give a value for cells before dosing. Cells were incubated at 37.degree. C., (5% CO.sub.2) for three days.

At the end of three days TCA was added to the plates to a final concentration of 16% (v/v). Plates were then incubated at 4.degree. C. for 1 hour, the supernatant removed and the plates washed in tap water. After drying, 100 .mu.l SRB dye (0.4% SRB in 1% acetic acid) was added for 30 minutes at 37.degree. C. Excess SRB was removed and the plates washed in 1% acetic acid. The SRB bound to protein was solubilised in 10 mM Tris pH7.5 and shaken for 30 minutes at room temperature. The ODs were read at 540 nm, and the concentration of inhibitor causing 50% inhibition of growth was determined from a semi-log plot of inhibitor concentration versus absorbance. The concentration of compound that reduced the optical density to below that obtained when the cells were plated at the start of the experiment gave the value for toxicity.

Typical IC.sub.50 values for compounds of the invention when tested in the SRB assay are in the range 1 mM to 1 nM.

According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a pharmaceutical composition which comprises a pyrimidine derivative of the formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or in vivo hydrolysable ester thereof, as defined hereinbefore in association with a pharmaceutically-acceptable diluent or carrier.

The composition may be in a form suitable for oral administration, for example as a tablet or capsule, for parenteral injection (including intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravascular or infusion) as a sterile solution, suspension or emulsion, for topical administration as an ointment or cream or for rectal administration as a suppository.

In general the above compositions may be prepared in a conventional manner using conventional excipients.

The compound of formula (I) will normally be administered to a warm-blooded animal at a unit dose within the range 5-5000 mg per square meter body area of the animal, i.e. approximately 0.1-100 mg/kg, and this normally provides a therapeutically-effective dose. A unit dose form such as a tablet or capsule will usually contain, for example 1-250 mg of active ingredient. Preferably a daily dose in the range of 1-50 mg/kg is employed. However the daily dose will necessarily be varied depending upon the host treated, the particular route of administration, and the severity of the illness being treated. Accordingly the optimum dosage may be determined by the practitioner who is treating any particular patient.

According to a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a compound of the formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or in vivo hydrolysable ester thereof, as defined hereinbefore for use in a method of treatment of the human or animal body by therapy.

Thus the compounds of the present invention provide a method for treating the proliferation of malignant cells characterised by inhibition of CDK enzymes, i.e. the compounds may be used to produce an anti-proliferative effect mediated alone or in part by the inhibition of CDKs. Such a compound of the invention is expected to possess a wide range of anti-cancer properties as CDKs have been implicated in many common human cancers such as leukaemia and breast, lung, colon, rectal, stomach, prostate, bladder, pancreas and ovarian cancer. Thus it is expected that a compound of the invention will possess anti-cancer activity against these cancers. It is in addition expected that a compound of the present invention will possess activity against a range of leukaemias, lymphoid malignancies and solid tumours such as carcinomas and sarcomas in tissues such as the liver, kidney, prostate and pancreas.

Preventing cells from entering DNA synthesis by inhibition of essential S-phase initiating activities such as CDK2 initiation may also be useful in protecting normal cells of the body from toxicity of cycle-specific pharmaceutical agents.

The volatiles were removed by evaporation and the residue dissolved in EtOH (75 ml) and the solution stirred under nitrogen. Sodium borohydride (1.04 g, 27.6 mmol) was added rapidly in one portion and the mixture stirred for 20 hours at ambient temperature. The volatiles were removed by evaporation and the residue dissolved in diethyl ether and water and the aqueous layer adjusted to pH 5.5 by careful addition of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The layers were separated and the aqueous layer adjusted to pH 11.5 by careful addition of 40% aqueous sodium hydroxide solution. The aqueous layer was then extracted with DCM (.times.3) and the organic extracts combined, dried (Na.sub.2SO.sub.4) and the solvent removed by evaporation. The residue was triturated with DCM/isohexane, the solid product collected by filtration, washed with isohexane and dried to give the title compound (4.12 g, 75%) as cream solid. NMR: 2.62 (t, 2H), 3.28 (s, 2H), 3.47 (t, 2H), 4.47 (s, 1H), 6.9 (m, 2H), 7.25 (t, 2H), 7.78 (d, 2H), 8.4 (d, 1H), 9.5 (s, 1H); m/z 245.

Method 20

2-Anilino-4-(3-oxomorpholinomethyl)pyrimidine

A solution of chloroacetyl chloride (268 mg, 2.38 mmol) in dry DCM (5 ml) was added dropwise over 10 minutes to a stirred solution of 2-anilino-4-(2-hydroxyethylaminomethyl)pyrimidine (Method 19; 582 mg, 2.38 mmol) and triethylamine (332 .mu.l, 2.38 mmol) in dry DCM (20 ml) under nitrogen. The reaction mixture was then stirred for 20 hours at ambient temperature. The mixture was diluted with DCM and washed with water (.times.2), saturated brine, dried (Na.sub.2SO.sub.4) and the volatiles removed by evaporation. The residue was dissolved in dry THF (20 ml), sodium bromide (227 mg, 2.2 mmol) added and the mixture stirred at 0.degree. C. under nitrogen sodium hydride (88 mg of a 60% dispersion in oil) was added in one portion and the reaction stirred at 0.degree. C. for 10 minutes and then at ambient temperature for 72 hours. The volatiles were removed by evaporation and the residue partition between EtOAc and water. The layers were separated and the organic layer washed with water, saturated brine, dried (Na.sub.2SO.sub.4) and the solvent removed by evaporation. The residue was purified by chromatography eluting with EtOAc. The purified product was triturated with diethyl ether, collected by filtration, washed with diethyl ether and dried to give the title compound (438 mg, 70%) as a white solid. NMR: 3.43 (t, 2H), 3.87 (t, 2H), 4.13 (s, 2H),4.52 (s, 2H), 6.72 (d, 1H), 6.93 (t, 1H), 7.25 (t 2H), 7.75 (d, 2H), 8.42 (d, 1H), 9.55 (s, 1H); m/z 285.
