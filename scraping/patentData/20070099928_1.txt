Description


FIELD OF THE INVENTION

[0001] The present invention relates to a tert-butylamine salt, a piperazine salt, a choline salt, a tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamine salt, a lysine or an adamantylamine salt of (-)-2-{[2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethyl]thio}-3-[4-(2-{4-[(methylsulfonyl)oxy]ph- enoxy}ethyl)phenyl]propanoic acid, to processes for their preparation, to their use in treating clinical conditions including lipid disorders (dyslipidemias) whether or not associated with insulin resistance and other manifestations of the metabolic syndrome, and to pharmaceutical compositions containing them

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

[0002] The metabolic syndrome including type 2 diabetes mellitus, refers to a cluster of manifestations including insulin resistance with accompanying hyperinsulinaemia, possibly type 2 diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension, central (visceral) obesity, dyslipidaemia observed as deranged lipoprotein levels typically characterised by elevated VLDL (very low density lipoproteins), small dense LDL particles and reduced HDL (high density lipoprotein) concentrations and reduced fibrinolysis.

[0003] Recent epidemiological research has documented that individuals with insulin resistance run a greatly increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, notably suffering from myocardial infarction and stroke. In type 2 diabetes mellitus atherosclerosis related conditions cause up to 80% of all deaths.

[0004] In clinical medicine there is awareness of the need to increase the insulin sensitivity in patients with the metabolic syndrome and thus to correct the dyslipidaemia which is considered to cause the accelerated progress of atherosclerosis. However, currently this is not a universally accepted diagnosis with well-defined pharmacotherapeutic indications.

[0005] Co-pending PCT application No. PCT/GB02/05743 discloses compounds of formula A ##STR1## wherein R.sup.1 represents chloro, fluoro or hydroxy as well as optical isomers and racemates thereof as well as pharmaceutically acceptable salts, prodrugs, solvates and crystalline forms thereof which are selective PPAR.alpha. modulators (for a review of the PPARs (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors ) see T. M. Willson et al, J Med Chem 2000, Vol 43, 527). These compounds are effective in treating conditions associated with insulin resistance. Specific pharmaceutically-acceptable salts of compounds of the formula A are not disclosed in PCT/GB02/05743. Further, no information is provided in relation to how crystalline forms of compounds of the formula A, and particularly salts thereof, may be prepared. The (-) enantiomer of the compound in which R.sup.1 represents hydroxy is prepared as the free acid in this application. However, this compound is a thick oil with a syrup-like consistency and thus is not suitable for use in pharmaceutical formulations. Therefore there exists a need for a solid form of this compound which has physical and chemical properties suitable for use in pharmaceutical formulations. Many salts were tried but most of these either could not be formed in the solid state or were amorphous with a low glass transition temperature. Salts with suitable properties for pharmaceutical formulation have now been found.

[0006] In the formulation of drug compositions, it is important for the drug substance to be in a form in which it can be conveniently handled and processed. This is of importance, not only from the point of view of obtaining a commercially viable manufacturing process, but also from the point of view of subsequent manufacture of pharmaceutical formulations comprising the active compound.

[0007] Further, in the manufacture of drug compositions, it is important that a reliable, reproducible and constant plasma concentration profile of drug is provided following administration to a patient.

[0008] Chemical stability, solid state stability, and "shelf life" of the active ingredients are also very important factors. The drug substance, and compositions containing it, should preferably be capable of being effectively stored over appreciable periods of time, without exhibiting a significant change in the active component's physico-chemical characteristics (e.g. its chemical composition, density, hygroscopicity and solubility).

[0009] Moreover, it is also important to be able to provide the drug in a form which is as chemically pure as possible.

[0010] The skilled person will appreciate that, typically, if a drug can be readily obtained in a stable form, such as a stable crystalline form, advantages may be provided, in terms of ease of handling, ease of preparation of suitable pharmaceutical formulations, and a more reliable solubility profile.

DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

[0011] The present invention provides a tert-butylamine salt, a piperazine salt, a choline salt, a tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamine salt, a lysine salt or an adamantylamine a salt of (-)-2-{[2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethyl]thio}-3-[4-(2-{4-[(methylsulfonyl)oxy]ph- enoxy}-ethyl)phenyl]propanoic acid.

[0012] In particular the present invention provides a tert-butylamine salt, a piperazine salt, a choline salt or a tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamine salt of (-)-2-{[2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethyl]thio }-3-[4-(2-{4-[(methylsulfonyl)oxy]phenoxy}ethyl)phenyl]propanoic acid.

[0013] It will be understood that the present invention includes one or any combination of more than one of the above salts.

[0014] We have found that certain compounds of the invention have the advantage that they may be prepared in crystalline form.

[0015] According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a compound of the invention in substantially crystalline form.

[0016] Although we have found that it is possible to produce compounds of the invention in forms which are greater than 80% crystalline, by "substantially crystalline" we include greater than 20%, preferably greater than 30%, and more preferably greater than 40% (e.g. greater than any of 50, 60, 70, 80 or 90%) crystalline.

[0017] According to a frter aspect of the invention there is also provided a compound of the invention in partially crystalline form. By "partially crystalline" we include 5% or between 5% and 20% crystalline.

[0018] The degree (%) of crystallinity may be determined by the skilled person using X-ray owder diffraction (XRPD). Other techniques, such as solid state NMR, FT-IR, Raman spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and microcalorimetry, may also be used.

[0019] Compounds of the invention, and particularly crystalline compounds of the invention, may have improved stability when compared to compounds disclosed in PCT/GB02/05743.

[0020] The term "stability" as defined herein includes chemical stability and solid state stability.

[0021] By "chemical stability", we include that it may be possible to store compounds of the invention in an isolated form, or in the form of a formulation in which it is provided in admixture with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents or adjuvants (e.g. in an oral dosage form, such as a tablet, capsule etc.), under normal storage conditions, with an insignificant degree of chemical degradation or decomposition.

[0022] By "solid state stability", we include that it may be possible to store compounds of the invention in an isolated solid form, or in the form of a solid formulation in which it is provided in admixture with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents or adjuvants (e.g. in an oral dosage form, such as a tablet, capsule etc.), under normal storage conditions, with an insignificant degree of solid state transformation (e.g. crystallisation, recrystallisation, solid state phase transition, hydration, dehydration, solvatisation or desolvatisation).

[0023] Examples of "normal storage conditions" include temperatures of between minus 80 and plus 50.degree. C. (preferably between 0 and 40.degree. C. and more preferably room temperatures, such as 15 to 30.degree. C.), pressures of between 0.1 and 2 bars (preferably at atmospheric pressure), relative humidities of between 5 and 95% (preferably 10 to 60%), and/or exposure to 460 lux of UV/visible light, for prolonged periods (ie. greater than or equal to six months). Under such conditions, compounds of the invention may be found to be less than 15%, more preferably less than 10%, and especially less than 5%, chemically degraded/decomposed, or solid state transformed, as appropriate. The skilled person will appreciate that the above-mentioned upper and lower limits for temperature, pressure and relative humidity represent extremes of normal storage conditions, and that certain combinations of these extremes will not be experienced during normal storage (e.g. a temperature of 50.degree. C. and a pressure of 0.1 bar).

[0024] It may be possible to crystallise salts of compounds of formula A with or without the presence of a solvent system (e.g. crystallisation may be from a melt, under supercritical conditions, or achieved by sublimation). However, we prefer that crystallisation occurs from an appropriate solvent system.

[0025] According to a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a process for the preparation of a crystalline compound of the invention which comprises crystallising a compound of the invention from an appropriate solvent system.

[0026] Crystallisation temperatures and crystallisation times depend upon the salt that is to be crystallised, the concentration of that salt in solution, and the solvent system that is used.

[0027] Crystallisation may also be initiated and/or effected by way of standard techniques, for example with or without seeding with crystals of the appropriate crystalline compound of the invention.

[0028] Different crystalline forms of the compounds of the invention may be readily characterised using X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) methods, for example as described hereinafter.

[0029] In order to ensure that a particular crystalline form is prepared in the absence of other crystalline forms, crystallisations are preferably carried out by seeding with nuclei and/or seed crystals of the desired crystalline form in substantially complete absence of nuclei and/or seed crystals of other crystalline forms. Seed crystals of appropriate compound may be prepared, for example, by way of slow evaporation of solvent from a portion of solution of appropriate salt.

[0030] Compounds of the invention may be isolated using techniques which are well known to those skilled in the art, for example decanting, filtering or centrifuging.

[0031] Compounds may be dried using standard techniques.

[0032] Further purification of compounds of the invention may be effected using techniques, which are well known to those skilled in the art. For example impurities may be removed by way of recrystallisation from an appropriate solvent system. Suitable temperatures and times for the recrystallisation depend upon the concentration of the salt in solution, and upon the solvent system that is used.

[0033] When compounds of the invention are crystallised, or recrystallised, as described herein, the resultant salt may be in a form which has improved chemical and/or solid state stability, as mentioned hereinbefore.

[0034] Compounds of the invention have the advantage that they may be more efficacious, be less toxic, be longer acting, have a broader range of activity, be more potent, produce fewer side effects, be more easily absorbed, and/or have a better pharmacokinetic profile (e.g. higher oral bioavailability and/or lower clearance), than, and/or have other useful pharmacological, physical, or chemical, properties over, compounds known in the prior art. Compounds of the invention may have the further advantage that they may be administered less frequently than compounds known in the prior art.

[0035] Compounds of the invention may also have the advantage that they are in a form which provides for improved ease of handling. Further, compounds of the invention have the advantage that they may be produced in forms which may have improved chemical and/or solid state stability (including e.g. due to lower hygroscopicity). Thus, such compounds of the invention may be stable when stored over prolonged periods.

[0036] Compounds of the invention may also have the advantage that they may be crystallised in good yields, in a high purity, rapidly, conveniently, and at a low cost.

[0037] These salts have activity as medicaments, in particular the salts are selective agonists of PPAR.alpha., that is, their EC.sub.50 for PPAR.alpha. is at least ten times lower than their EC.sub.50 for PPAR.gamma. wherein the EC.sub.50s are measured and calculated as described in the assays later in this document. The compounds are potent and selective.

[0038] It will be understood by those skilled in the art that where (-) occurs in this specification that the acid has a negative rotation when measured using the conditions and concentration described in the experimental section. It should be understood that the salts of the present invention may have (+) rotation provided that the absolute configuration of the salt is the same as the configuration of the (-)-parent acid.

[0039] It will also be understood that the compounds of the present invention may exist in solvated, for example hydrated, as well as unsolvated forms. It is to be understood that the present invention encompasses all such solvated and unsolvated forms.

Methods of Preparation

[0040] The compound of the invention may be prepared as outlined below. However, the invention is not limited to these methods.

[0041] The salts may be prepared by reacting (-)-2-{[2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethyl]thio}-3-[4-(2-{4-[(methylsulfonyl)oxy]ph- enoxy}ethyl)phenyl]propanoic acid with the appropriate amine, for example tert-butylamine, piperazine, choline, tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamine, lysine or adamantanylamine in an inert solvent, for example ethanol, methanol, propan-2-ol, ethyl acetate, toluene or mixtures thereof or a mixture of ethanol or methanol or propan-2-ol and water, at a temperature in the range of 0-100.degree.

[0063] According to a further aspect of the invention there is thus provided a pharmaceutical formulation including the compound of the invention in admixture with pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvants, diluents and/or carriers.

Pharmacological Properties

[0064] A compound of the invention is useful for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of clinical conditions associated with inherent or induced reduced sensitivity to insulin (insulin resistance) and associated metabolic disorders (also known as metabolic syndrome). These clinical conditions will include, but will not be limited to, general obesity, abdominal obesity, arterial hypertension, hyperinsulinaemia, hyperglycaemia, type 2 diabetes and the dyslipidaemia characteristically appearing with insulin resistance. This dyslipidaemia, also known as the atherogenic lipoprotein profile, is characterised by moderately elevated non-esterified fatty acids, elevated very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) triglyceride rich particles, high Apo B levels, low high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels associated with low apo AI particle levels and high Apo B levels in the presence of small, dense, low density lipoproteins (LDL) particles, phenotype B.

[0065] A compound of the present invention is expected to be useful in treating patients with combined or mixed hyperlipidemias or various degrees of hypertriglyceridemias and postprandial dyslipidemia with or without other manifestations of the metabolic syndrome.

[0066] Treatment with the present compound is expected to lower the cardiovascular morbidity and mortality associated with atherosclerosis due to their antidyslipidaemic as well as antiinflammatory properties. The cardiovascular disease conditions include macro-angiopathies of various internal organs causing myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease and peripheral arterial insufficiency of the lower extremities. Because of its insulin sensitizing effect the compound iss also expected to prevent or delay the development of type 2 diabetes from the metabolic syndrome and diabetes of pregnancy. Therefore the development of long-term complications associated with chronic hyperglycaemia in diabetes mellitus such as the micro-angiopathies causing renal disease, retinal damage and peripheral vascular disease of the lower limbs are expected to be delayed. Furthermore the compound may be useful in treatment of various conditions outside the cardiovascular system whether or not associated with insulin resistance, like polycystic ovarian syndrome, obesity, cancer and states of inflammatory disease including neurodegenerative disorders such as mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis.

[0067] A compound of the present invention is expected to be useful in controlling glucose levels in patients suffering from type 2 diabetes.

[0068] The present invention provides a method of treating or preventing dyslipidemias, the insulin resistance syndrome and/or metabolic disorders (as defined above) comprising the administration of a compound of the present invention to a mammal (particularly a human) in need thereof.

[0069] The present invention provides a method of treating or preventing type 2 diabetes comprising the administration of an effective amount of a compound of the present invention to a mammal (particularly a human) in need thereof.

[0070] In a further aspect the present invention provides the use of a compound of the present invention as a medicament.

[0071] In a further aspect the present invention provides the use of a compound of the present invention in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of insulin resistance and/or metabolic disorders.

Combination Therapy

[0072] A compound of the invention may be combined with another therapeutic agent that is useful in the treatment of disorders associated with the development and progress of atherosclerosis such as hypertension, hyperlipidaemias, dyslipidaemias, diabetes and obesity. A compound of the invention may be combined with another therapeutic agent that decreases the ratio of LDL:HDL or an agent that causes a decrease in circulating levels of LDL-cholesterol. In patients with diabetes mellitus a compound of the invention may also be combined with therapeutic agents used to treat complications related to micro-angiopathies.

[0073] A compound of the invention may be used alongside other therapies for the treatment of metabolic syndrome or type 2 diabetes and its associated complications, these include biguanide drugs, for example metformin, phenformin and buformin, insulin (synthetic insulin analogues, amylin) and oral antihyperglycemics (these are divided into prandial glucose regulators and alpha-glucosidase inhibitors). An example of an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor is acarbose or voglibose or miglitol. An example of a prandial glucose regulator is repaglinide or is nateglinide.

[0074] In another aspect of the invention, the compound of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, may be administered in association with a PPAR modulating agent. PPAR modulating agents include but are not limited to a PPAR alpha and/or gamma and/or delta agonist, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates, solvates of such salts or prodrugs thereof.

[0153] .sup.1H NMR and .sup.13C NMR measurements were performed on a Varian Mercury 300 or Varian UNITY plus 400, 500 or 600 spectrometers, operating at .sup.1H frequencies of 300, 400, 500 and 600 MHz, respectively, and at .sup.13C frequencies of 75, 100, 125 and 150 MHz, respectively. Measurements were made on the delta scale (.delta.).

[0154] Unless otherwise stated, chemical shifts are given in ppm with the solvent as internal standard.

[0155] X-ray powder diffraction analysis (XRPD) was performed using variable slits on samples prepared according to standard methods without using any internal standard. Examples of standard methods used are those described in Giacovazzo, C. et al (1995), Fundamentals of Crystallography, Oxford University Press; Jenkins, R. and Snyder, R. L. (1996), Introduction to X-Ray Powder Diffractometry, John Wiley & Sons, New York; Bunn, C. W. (1948), Chemical Crystallography, Clarendon Press, London; or Klug, H. P. & Alexander, L. E. (1974), X-ray Diffraction Procedures, John Wiley and Sons, New York. X-ray analyses were performed using Cu-radiation on a Siemens D5000 diffractometer or a Philips X'Pert MPD. The X-axis in the figures below is 2-theta and the Y axis is intensity.

[0156] Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed using a Mettler DSC820, a Mettler DSC820E or a Perkin Elmer DSC 7 instrument, according to standard methods, for example those described in Hohne, G. W. H. et al (1996), Differential Scanning Calorimetry, Springer, Berlin.

[0157] Thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed using a Mettler Toledo TGA850, a Mettler Toledo TG851 or a Perkin Elmer TGA 7 instrument. A ramp rate of 10.degree. C./min was used.

[0158] It will be appreciated by the skilled person that crystalline forms of compounds of the invention may be prepared by analogy with processes described herein and/or in accordance with the Examples below, and may show essentially the same XRPD diffraction patterns and/or DSC and/or TGA thermograms as those disclosed herein. By "essentially the same" XRPD diffraction patterns and/or DSC and/or TGA thermograms, we include those instances when it is clear from the relevant patterns and/or thermograms (allowing for experimental error) that essentially the same crystalline form has been formed. When provided, DSC onset temperatures may vary in the range .+-.5.degree. C. (e.g. .+-.2.degree. C.), and XRPD distance values may vary in the range .+-.2 on the last decimal place. It will be appreciated by the skilled person that XRPD intensities may vary when measured for essentially the same crystalline form for a variety of reasons including, for example, preferred orientation.

[0159] .sup.1H NMR and .sup.13C NMR measurements were performed on a Varian Mercury 300 or Varian UNITY plus 400, 500 or 600 spectrometers, operating at .sup.1H frequencies of 300, 400, 500 and 600 MHz, respectively, and at .sup.13C frequencies of 75, 100, 125 and 150 MHz, respectively.

Standard XRD Measurement Conditions for Figures C, D and B

[0196] Samples are spun at 30 rpm to improve counting statistics. X-rays are generated by a: `copper long-fine focus tube` operated at 40 kV and 40 mA, wavelength of X-rays -1.5418 .ANG.. The data for each sample are obtained using the standard scintillation detector. The collimated X-ray source was passed through an Automatic Variable Divergence Slit set at V20 (20 mm path-length) and the reflected radiation directed through a 2 mm anti-scatter slit and a 0.2 mm detector slit. Each sample is exposed for 4 seconds per 0.020.degree. 2.theta. increment (continuous scan mode) over the range 2.degree. to 40.degree. 2.theta. in theta-theta mode. N.B. Running time for each sample is thus 2 hours 6 minutes 40 seconds. Note that the secondary soller slit is left in position.
