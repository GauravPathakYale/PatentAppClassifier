Description


FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to new pharmaceutically acceptable salts of N-[5-methyl-8-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-2-naphthyl]-4-mo rpholinobenzamide as the (R)-enantiomer, the (S)-enantiomer or the racemate or as solvates of said salts, a process for their preparation, pharmaceutical formulations containing said salts or solvates and to the use of said active salts or solvates in therapy.

An object of the invention is to provide compounds for therapeutic use, especially compounds having a selective effect at a subgroup of 5-hydroxytryptamine receptors, designated the h5-HT.sub.1B -receptor (previously called the 5-HT.sub.1D.beta. -receptor) in mammals including man, which compounds are easily formulated into pharmaceutical formulations.

It is also an object of the invention to provide compounds with a therapeutic effect after oral administration.

PRIOR ART

Different classes of piperazinyl substituted benzanilide derivatives as 5-HT.sub.1D antagonists are disclosed in inter alia EP 533266, EP 533267, EP 533268, GB 2273930 and WO 95/11243.

WO 94/13659 discloses an extremely broad class of fused benzo compounds having a para substituted piperidyl or piperazinyl radical in the aromatic ring, said class or compounds is stated to bind to the 5-HT.sub.1A receptor.

WO 94/21619 discloses a fully aromatic naphthalene ring system which may be substituted with a piperidyl or piperazinyl group, said compounds are also stated to be potent serotonin (5HT.sub.1) agonists and antagonists.

EP 402923 discloses 2-aminoalkyl or alkylenaromatic substituted 1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene derivatives having a further nitrogen substitution in the 5 position in the tetraline ring, said compounds act as dopamine agonists.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Various central nervous system disorders such as depression, anxiety, etc. appear to involve the disturbance of the neurotransmitters noradrenaline (NA) and/or 5-hydroxytryptamine(5-HT), the latter also known as serotonin. The drugs most frequently used in the treatment of depression are believed to act by improving the neurotransmission of either or both of these physiological agonists. It appears that the enhancement of 5-HT neurotransmission primarily affects the depressed mood and anxiety, whereas the enhancement of noradrenaline neurotransmission affects the retardation symptoms occurring in depressed patients.

Serotonin, or 5-HT, activity is thought to be involved in many different types of psychiatric disorders. For instance it is thought that an increase in 5-HT activity is associated with anxiety, while a decrease in 5-HT release has been associated with depression. Serotonin has in addition been implicated in such diverse conditions as eating disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, cardiovascular regulation and sexual behavior.

The compound of formula I below in base form has an extremely low solubility in water and a slow release rate which rate is pH dependent, i.e. the rate is different in the stomach and the intestines. From a pharmaceutical formulation point of view it is very difficult to dissolve the base rapidly enough and maintain the same dissolved in the gastric juice until a sufficient amount of substance has been absorbed.

The 5-HT Receptors

The various effects of 5-HT may be related to the fact that serotoninergic neurons stimulate the secretion of several hormones, e.g. cortisol, prolactin, B-endorphin, vasopressin and others. The secretion of each of these other hormones appears to be regulated on a specific basis by several different 5-HT (serotonin) receptor subtypes. With the aid of molecular biology techniques, to date these receptors have been classified as 5-HT.sub.1, 5-HT.sub.2, 5-HT.sub.3, 5-HT.sub.4, 5-HT.sub.5, 5-HT.sub.6 and 5-HT.sub.7 with the .sup.5 -HT.sub.1 receptor further divided into the 5-HT.sub.1A, 5-HT.sub.1B, 5-HT.sub.1D, 5-HT.sub.1E and 5-HT.sub.1F subtypes. Each receptor subtype is involved in a different serotonin function and has different properties.

Regulation of the 5-HT transmission

The release of 5-HT at the nerve terminals is feedback-regulated by two different subtypes of 5-HT receptors. Inhibitory 5-HT.sub.1A autoreceptors are located on the cell bodies in the raphe nuclei which upon stimulation by 5-HT decrease the impulse propagation in the 5-HT neurons and thereby reducing the 5-HT release at the nerve terminals. Another subtype of inhibitory 5-HT receptors is located on the 5-HT nerve terminals, the h5-HT.sub.1B receptors (in rodents the r5-HT.sub.1B receptors) which regulate the synaptic concentration of 5-HT by controlling the amount of 5-HT that is released. An antagonist of these terminal autoreceptors thus increases the amount of 5-HT released by nerve impulses as has been shown in both in vitro and in vivo experiments.

The use of an antagonist of the terminal h5-HT.sub.1B autoreceptor will accordingly increase the synaptic 5-HT concentration and enhance the transmission in the 5-HT system. It would thus produce an antidepressant effect making it useful as a medication for depression.

Other localizations of h5-HT.sub.1B receptor subtype also exist. A large part of these postsynaptic receptors appear to be located on nerve terminals of other neuronal systems (so called heteroreceptors). Since the h5-HT.sub.1B receptor mediates inhibitory responses an antagonist of this receptor subtype might also increase the release of other neurotransmitters than 5-HT.

Compounds having h5-HT.sub.1B activity may according to well known and recognised pharmacological tests be divided into full agonists, partial agonists and antagonists.

DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION

The object of the present invention is to provide compounds having a selective effect at the h5-HT.sub.1B receptor, preferably antagonistic properties, as well as having a good bioavailability and which may easily be formulated into pharmaceutical formulations. The compounds according to the invention have surprisingly solved the above problem since they are dissolved rapidly enough and are maintained dissolved in the gastric juice until a sufficient amount of substance has been absorbed

C. to room temperature, followed by cleavage of the benzyl groups by hydrogenation over a suitable catalyst containing palladium, rhodium, platinum or nickel, in a suitable solvent e.g. acetic acid or ethanol and at a reaction temperature between +20.degree. C. and +120.degree. C.

Method of Preparation of End Product.

Another object of the invention is a process for the preparation of the compound of the invention by acylation of a compound of formula XII, ##STR12##

with activated 4-morpholinobenzoic acid and reacting the base with an organic or inorganic acid to form the salt with or without a solvate.

Thus, the acylation may be carried out by reacting the compound of formula XII with the acid chloride or acid bromide of 4-morpholinobenzoic acid in a suitable solvent such as methylene chloride or chloroform with a suitable base e.g. trialkylamine such as triethylamine at a temperature between -20.degree. C. and reflux temperature or by activating the carboxylic acid function in 4-morpholinobenzoic acid with an activating reagent such as N,N'-carbonyldiimidazole, N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide or diphenylphosphinic chloride with or without a suitable base such as N-methylmorpholine in a suitable solvent such as N,N-dimethylformamide or tetrahydrofuran and the reaction may be conducted at a temperature between +20.degree. C. and +150.degree. C.

Furthermore, the pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the compound of the formula I may be obtained by reacting the base with the appropriate acid in a suitable solvent such as an alcohol e.g. methanol, ethanol or 2-propanol or another suitable solvent such as water, ethyl acetate, hexane, tetrahydrofuran, acetone, acetonitrile, chloroform or mixtures thereof. The process may be carried out at various temperatures between -30 and reflux. The salt formed in the above process may be formed as a solvate.

Pharmacology

Electrical field stimulation of [.sup.3 H] -5-HT release from occipital cortex of guinea pigs [.sup.3 H] -5-HT is released by electrical field stimulation from slices of occipital cortex of guinea pigs which have been pre-incubated with [.sup.3 H] -5-HT. This release is similar to that caused by nerve stimulation, i.e. exocytotical release from serotonergic nerve terminals, depending on the presence of Ca.sup.2+ in the incubation medium. The 5-HT release is regulated at the level of the nerve terminals by autoreceptors, in the guinea pigs (like in humans) belonging to the h5-HT.sup.1B receptor subtype. Thus, agonists of h5-HT.sup.1B receptors reduce the amount of [3H]-5-HT released by field stimulation whereas the release is increased by antagonists of this receptor type. Testing compounds with this method is accordingly a convenient screening technique for determining the potency and functional effect of new h5-HTIB receptor agonists and antagonists.

Methods and Materials

The buffer is gassed for at least 30 min before use. The pH of the buffer is about 7.2 at room temperature but it rises to about 7.4 at 37.degree. C.

Preparation of Occipital Cortical Slices

Guinea pigs (200-250 g) were decapitated and the whole brain was removed. The occipital cortex was dissected and cut to slices 0.4.times.4 mm with McIlwain chopper machine. The white part of the tissue should be removed carefully with a tweezers before slicing. The slices were incubated in 5 ml buffer in the presence of 5 mM pargyline chloride. After incubation with 0.1 mM [.sup.3 H]-5-HT for another 30 min the slices were transferred to a test tube and washed three times with same volume buffer. The slices were transferred to the superfusion chambers with a plastic pipette and were washed for 40 min with the buffer in the presence of uptake inhibitor citalopram 2.5 .mu.M with a flow 0.5 ml/min.

Electrical Stimulation of 5-HT Release

The superfused buffer was collected in 2 mL fractions. The slices were stimulated by electricity with a train of pulses of frequency 3 Hz, duration 2 ms and current 30 mA for 3 min at the 4th and 13th fractions. The tested drugs were added from the 8th fraction to the end of experiment.

Results

Between the first and a second stimulation the h5-HT.sub.1B antagonist is added to the media which results in a dose depending increase of the release(S.sub.2) after the second stimulation. See FIG. 1.

The S.sub.2 /S.sub.1 ratio which is the per cent of released [.sup.3 H]-5-HT at the second stimulation (S.sub.2) divided by that of the first stimulation (S.sub.1) was used to estimate drug effects on transmitter release.

Solubility Determination of (R)-N-15-Methyl-8-(4-Methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1,2,3,4-Tetrahydro-2-Naphthyl]- 4-Morpholinobenzamide and it's corresponding Salts.

Method

Excess of (R)-N-[5-methyl-8-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-2-naphthyl]- 4-morpholinobenzamide or it's corresponding salts was added to purified water. The solution was agitated overnight in a water bath, kept at 25.degree. C. by using a thermostat (Julabo SW and U3, 60 strokes/min). The saturated solution was centrifuged and filtered through a 0.45 .quadrature.m Gelman GHP Acrodisc.RTM. 13 filter, diluted and assayed by HPLC.
