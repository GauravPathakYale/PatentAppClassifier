Description


[0001] The invention concerns certain novel quinazoline derivatives, or pharmaceutically-acceptable salts thereof, which possess anti-tumour activity and are accordingly useful in methods of treatment of the human or animal body. The invention also concerns processes for the manufacture of said quinazoline derivatives, to pharmaceutical compositions containing them and to their use in therapeutic methods, for example in the manufacture of medicaments for use in the prevention or treatment of solid tumour disease in a warm-blooded animal such as man.

[0002] Many of the current treatment regimes for diseases resulting from the abnormal regulation of cellular proliferation such as psoriasis and cancer, utilise compounds that inhibit DNA synthesis and cellular proliferation. To date, compounds used in such treatments are generally toxic to cells however their enhanced effects on rapidly dividing cells such as tumour cells can be beneficial. Alternative approaches to these cytotoxic anti-tumour agents are currently being developed, for example selective inhibitors of cell signalling pathways. These types of inhibitors are likely to have the potential to display an enhanced selectivity of action against tumour cells and so are likely to reduce the probability of the therapy possessing unwanted side effects.

[0003] Eukaryotic cells are continually responding to many diverse extracellular signals that enable communication between cells within an organism. These signals regulate a wide variety of physical responses in the cell including proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and motility. The extracellular signals take the form of a diverse variety of soluble factors including growth factors as well as paracrine and endocrine factors. By binding to specific transmembrane receptors, these ligands integrate the extracellular signal to the intracellular signalling pathways, therefore transducing the signal across the plasma membrane and allowing the individual cell to respond to its extracellular signals. Many of these signal transduction processes utilise the reversible process of the phosphorylation of proteins that are involved in the promotion of these diverse cellular responses. The phosphorylation status of target proteins is regulated by specific kinases and phosphatases that are responsible for the regulation of about one third of all proteins encoded by the mammalian genome. As phosphorylation is such an important regulatory mechanism in the signal transduction process, it is therefore not surprising that aberrations in these intracellular pathways result in abnormal cell growth and differentiation and so promote cellular transformation (reviewed in Cohen et al, Curr Opin Chem Biol, 1999, 3, 459-465).

[0004] It has been widely shown that a number of these tyrosine kinases are mutated to constitutively active forms and/or when over-expressed result in the transformation of a variety of human cells. These mutated and over-expressed forms of the kinase are present in a large proportion of human tumours (reviewed in Kolibaba et al, Biochimica et Biophysica Acta, 1997, 133, F217-F248). As tyrosine kinases play fundamental roles in the proliferation and differentiation of a variety of tissues, much focus has centred on these enzymes in the development of novel anti-cancer therapies. This family of enzymes is divided into two groups--receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases e.g. EGF Receptors and the SRC family respectively. From the results of a large number of studies including the Human Genome Project, about 90 tyrosine kinase have been identified in the human genome, of this 58 are of the receptor type and 32 are of the non-receptor type. These can be compartmentalised in to 20 receptor tyrosine kinase and 10 non-receptor tyrosine kinase sub-families (Robinson et al, Oncogene, 2000, 19, 5548-5557).

[0005] The receptor tyrosine kinases are of particular importance in the transmission of mitogenic signals that initiate cellular replication. These large glycoproteins, which span the plasma membrane of the cell possess an extracellular binding domain for their specific ligands (such as Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) for the EGF Receptor). Binding of ligand results in the activation of the receptor's kinase enzymatic activity that is encoded by the intracellular portion of the receptor. This activity phosphorylates key tyrosine amino acids in target proteins, resulting in the transduction of proliferative signals across the plasma membrane of the cell.

[0006] It is known that the erbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases, which include EGFR, erbB2, erbB3 and erbB4, are frequently involved in driving the proliferation and survival of tumour cells (reviewed in Olayioye et al., EMBO J., 2000, 19, 3159). One mechanism in which this can be accomplished is by overexpression of the receptor at the protein level, generally as a result of gene amplification. This has been observed in many common human cancers (reviewed in Klapper et al., Adv. Cancer Res., 2000, 77, 25) such as breast cancer (Sainsbury et al., Brit. J. Cancer, 1988, 58, 458; Guerin et al., Oncogene Res., 1988, 3, 21; Slamon et al., Science, 1989, 244, 707; Klijn et al., Breast Cancer Res. Treat., 1994, 29, 73 and reviewed in Salomon et al., Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol., 1995, 19, 183), non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) including adenocarcinomas (Cerny et al., Brit. J. Cancer, 1986, 54, 265; Reubi et al., Int. J. Cancer, 1990, 45, 269; Rusch et al., Cancer Research, 1993, 53, 2379; Brabender et al Clin. Cancer Res., 2001, 7, 1850) as well as other cancers of the lung (Hendler et al., Cancer Cells, 1989, 7, 347; Ohsaki et al., Oncol. Rep., 2000, 7, 603), bladder cancer (Neal et al., Lancet, 1985, 366; Chow et al., Clin. Cancer Res., 2001, 7, 1957, Zhau et al., Mol. Carcinog., 3, 254), oesophageal cancer (Mukaida et al., Cancer, 1991, 68, 142), gastrointestinal cancer such as colon, rectal or stomach cancer (Bolen et al., Oncogene Res., 1987, 1, 149; Kapitanovic et al., Gastroenterology, 2000, 112, 1103; Ross et al., Cancer Invest., 2001, 19, 554), cancer of the prostate (Visakorpi et al. Histochem. J., 1992, 24, 481; Kumar et al., 2000, 32, 73; Scher et al., J. Natl. Cancer Inst., 2000, 92, 1866), leukaemia (Konaka et al., Cell, 1984, 37, 1035, Martin-Subero et al., Cancer Genet Cytogenet., 2001, 127, 174), ovarian (Hellstrom et al., Cancer Res., 2001, 61, 2420), head and neck (Shiga et al., Head Neck, 2000, 22, 599) or pancreatic cancer (Ovotny et al., Neoplasma, 2001, 48, 188). As more human tumour tissues are tested for expression of the erbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases it is expected that their widespread prevalence and importance will be further enhanced in the future.

[0007] As a consequence of the mis-regulation of one or more of these receptors, it is widely believed that many tumours become clinically more aggressive and so correlate with a poorer prognosis for the patient (Brabender et al. Clin. Cancer Res., 2001, 7, 1850; Ross et al., Cancer Investigation, 2001, 19, 554, Yu et al., Bioessays, 2000, 22.7, 673). In addition to these clinical findings, a wealth of pre-clinical information suggests that the erbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases are involved in cellular transformation. This includes the observations that many tumour cell lines overexpress one or more of the erbB receptors and that EGFR or erbB2 when transfected into non-tumour cells have the ability to transform these cells. This tumourigenic potential has been further verified as transgenic mice that overexpress erbB2 spontaneously develop tumours in the mammary gland. In addition to this, a number of pre-clinical studies have demonstrated that anti-proliferative effects can be induced by knocking out one or more erbB activities by small molecule inhibitors, dominant negatives or inhibitory antibodies (reviewed in Mendelsohn et al., Oncogene, 2000, 19, 6550). Thus it has been recognised that inhibitors of these receptor tyrosine kinases should be of value as a selective inhibitor of the proliferation of mammalian cancer cells (Yaish et al. Science, 1988, 242, 933, Kolibaba et al, Biochimica et Biophysica Acta, 1997, 133, F217-F248; Al-Obeidi et al, 2000, Oncogene, 19, 5690-5701; Mendelsohn et al, 2000, Oncogene, 19, 6550-6565). In addition to this pre-clinical data, findings using inhibitory antibodies against EGFR and erbB2 (c-225 and trastuzumab respectively) have proven to be beneficial in the clinic for the treatment of selected solid tumours (reviewed in Mendelsohn et al, 2000, Oncogene, 19, 6550-6565).

[0008] Amplification and/or activity of members of the erbB type receptor tyrosine kinases have been detected and so have been implicated to play a role in a number of non-malignant proliferative disorders such as psoriasis (Ben-Bassat, Curr. Pharm. Des., 2000, 6, 933; Elder et al., Science, 1989, 243, 811), benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) (Kumar et al, Int. Urol. Nephrol., 2000, 32, 73), atherosclerosis and restenosis (Bokemeyer et al., Kidney Int., 2000, 58, 549). It is therefore expected that inhibitors of erbB type receptor tyrosine kinases will be useful in the treatment of these and other non-malignant disorders of excessive cellular proliferation.

[0009] European patent application EP 566 226 discloses certain 4-anilinoquinazolines that are receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors.

[0010] International patent application publication numbers WO 96/33977, WO 96/33978, WO 96/33979, WO 96/33980, WO 96/33981, WO 97/30034 and WO 97/38994 disclose that certain quinazoline derivatives which bear an anilino substituent at the 4-position and a substituent at the 6- and/or 7-position possess receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitory activity.

[0011] European patent application EP 837 063 discloses aryl substituted 4-aminoquinazoline derivatives carrying a moiety containing an aryl or heteroaryl group at the 6- or 7-position on the quinazoline ring. The compounds are stated to be useful for treating hyperproliferative disorders.

[0012] International patent application publication numbers WO 97/30035 and WO 98/13354 disclose certain 4-anilinoquinazolines substituted at the 7-position are vascular endothelial growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors.

[0013] International patent application publication numbers WO 00/55141, WO 00/51991 and WO 02/18372 disclose 6,7-substituted 4-anilinoquinazoline compounds characterised in that the substituents at the 6- and/or 7-position carry an ester linked moiety (RO--CO) or a lactone ring.

[0014] International patent application publication number WO 00/56720 discloses 6,7-dialkoxy-4-anilinoquinazoline compounds for the treatment of cancer or allergic reactions.

[0015] International patent application publication number WO 02/41882 discloses 4-anilinoquinazoline compounds substituted at the 6- and/or 7-position by a substituted pyrrolidinyl-alkoxy or piperidinyl-alkoxy group.

[0016] International patent application publication numbers WO 98/02434, WO 99/35132, WO 00/44728 and WO 01/98277 disclose 4-anilinoquinazolines wherein the anilino group is substituted with an aryl or heteroaryl containing moiety.

[0017] We have now surprisingly found that other 4-anilinoquinazoline derivatives possess potent anti-tumour activity. Without wishing to imply that the compounds disclosed in the present invention possess pharmacological activity only by virtue of an effect on a single biological process, it is believed that the compounds provide an anti-tumour effect by way of inhibition of one or more of the erbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases that are involved in the signal transduction steps which lead to the proliferation of tumour cells. In particular, it is believed that the compounds of the present invention provide an anti-tumour effect by way of inhibition of EGFR and/or erbB2 receptor tyrosine kinases.

[0018] Generally the compounds of the present invention possess potent inhibitory activity against the erbB receptor tyrosine kinase family, for example by inhibition of EGFR and/or erbB2 and/or erbB4 receptor tyrosine kinases, whilst possessing less potent inhibitory activity against other kinases. Furthermore, certain compounds of the present invention possess substantially better potency against the EGFR over that of the erbB2 tyrosine kinase. The invention also includes compounds that are active against all or a combination of EGFR, erbB2 and erbB4 receptor tyrosine kinases, thus potentially providing treatments for conditions mediated by one or more of these receptor tyrosine kinases.

[0019] Generally the compounds of the present invention exhibit favourable physical properties such as a high solubility whilst retaining high antiproliferative activity. Many of the compounds of the invention posses favourable DMPK properties, for example high bioavailability and/or high free-plasma levels and/or advantageous half life and such properties are expected to provide improved in-vivo efficacy and may reduce inter-patient variability in exposure to the compound compared to other EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as gefitinib. Furthermore, many of the compounds according to the present invention are inactive or only weakly active in a hERG assay.

[0064] R.sup.20 is hydrogen, (1-6C)alkyl, or (1-6C)alkoxy(2-6C)alkyl;

or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.

[0065] Preferably in the quinazoline of Formula IA when a group R.sup.9 is hydroxy, n is 2, and the carbon atom to which the hydroxy or (1-4C)alkoxy group is attached is not also attached to another oxygen or a nitrogen atom.

[0066] In this specification the generic term "alkyl" includes both straight-chain and branched-chain alkyl groups such as propyl, isopropyl and tert-butyl, and (3-8C)cycloalkyl groups such as cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl and cycloheptyl. However references to individual alkyl groups such as "propyl" are specific for the straight-chain version only, references to individual branched-chain alkyl groups such as "isopropyl" are specific for the branched-chain version only and references to individual cycloalkyl groups such as "cyclopentyl" are specific for that 5-membered ring only. An analogous convention applies to other generic terms, for example (1-6C)alkoxy includes methoxy, ethoxy, cyclopropyloxy and cyclopentyloxy, (1-6C)alkylamino includes methylamino, ethylamino, cyclobutylamino and cyclohexylamino, and di-[(1-6Calkyl]amino includes dimethylamino, diethylamino, N-cyclobutyl-N-methylamino and N-cyclohexyl-N-ethylamino.

[0067] The term "aryl" refers to aromatic hydrocarbon rings such as phenyl or naphthyl, particularly phenyl. The terms "heterocyclic" or "heterocyclyl" include ring structures that may be mono- or bicyclic and contain from 3 to 15 atoms, at least one of which, and suitably from 1 to 4 of which, is a heteroatom such as oxygen, sulfur or nitrogen. Unless specified otherwise herein, rings within a heterocyclyl group may be aromatic, non-aromatic or partially aromatic in the sense that one ring of a fused ring system may be aromatic and the other non-aromatic. Particular examples of such ring systems include furyl, benzofuranyl, tetrahydrofuryl, chromanyl, thienyl, benzothienyl, pyridyl, piperidinyl, quinolyl, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolinyl, isoquinolyl, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolinyl, pyrazinyl, piperazinyl, pyrimidinyl, pyridazinyl, quinoxalinyl, quinazolinyl, cinnolinyl, pyrrolyl, pyrrolidinyl, indolyl, indolinyl, imidazolyl, benzimidazolyl, pyrazolyl, indazolyl, oxazolyl, benzoxazolyl, isoxazolyl, thiazolyl, benzothiazolyl, isothiazolyl, morpholinyl, 4H-1,4-benzoxazinyl, 4H-1,4-benzothiazinyl, 1,2,3-triazolyl, 1,2,4-triazolyl, oxadiazolyl, furazanyl, thiadiazolyl, tetrazolyl, dibenzofuranyl, dibenzothienyl oxiranyl, oxetanyl, azetidinyl, tetrahydropyranyl, oxepanyl, oxazepanyl, 1,3-thiazolidinyl, tetrahydro-1,4-thiazinyl, 1,1-dioxotetrahydro-1,4-thiazinyl, homopiperidinyl, homopiperazinyl, dihydropyridinyl, tetrahydropyridinyl, dihydropyrimidinyl, tetrahydropyrimidinyl, tetrahydrothienyl, tetrahydrothiopyranyl or thiomorpholinyl.

[0068] Where rings include nitrogen atoms, these may carry a hydrogen atom or a substituent group such as an (1-6C)alkyl group if required to fulfil the bonding requirements of nitrogen, or they may be linked to the rest of the structure by way of the nitrogen atom. A nitrogen atom within a heterocyclyl group may be oxidized to give the corresponding N oxide.

[0069] The term "heteroaryl" used herein refers to heterocyclyl groups which are completely aromatic in nature. Particular examples of such ring systems include furyl, benzofuranyl, thienyl, benzothienyl, pyridyl, quinolyl, isoquinolyl, pyrazinyl, pyrimidinyl, pyridazinyl, quinoxalinyl, quinazolinyl, cinnolinyl, pyrrolyl, indolyl, indolinyl, imidazolyl, benzimidazolyl, pyrazolyl, indazolyl, oxazolyl, benzoxazolyl, isoxazolyl, thiazolyl, benzothiazolyl, isothiazolyl, 1,2,3-triazolyl, 1,2,4-triazolyl, oxadiazolyl, furazanyl, thiadiazolyl, tetrazolyl, dibenzofuranyl or dibenzothienyl

[0070] Where, for example Z is heteroaryl, or contains a heteroaryl group, said heteroaryl group is suitably a 5 or 6-membered heteroaryl group which contains one or more heteroatoms selected from oxygen, nitrogen or sulfur. Particular 5 or 6 membered heteroaryl groups include those selected from furyl, thienyl, pyridyl, pyrazinyl, pyrimidinyl, pyridazinyl, pyrrolyl, imidazolyl, pyrazolyl, oxazolyl, isoxazolyl, thiazolyl, isothiazolyl, 1,2,3-triazolyl, 1,2,4-triazolyl, oxadiazolyl, furazanyl, thiadiazolyl, tetrazolyl. The heteroaryl group may also be a 9 or 10 membered bicyclic heteroaryl ring system such as quinolinyl, isoquinolinyl, cinnolinyl, quinazolinyl, phthalazinyl, quinoxalinyl, indolyl, isoindolyl, benzofuranyl, benzothienyl, benzimidazolyl, benzothiazolyl or purinyl.

[0071] Particular examples of heteroaryl include 5-membered rings such as furyl, thienyl, pyrrolyl, pyrazolyl, imidazolyl, oxazolyl, isoxazolyl, thiazolyl, isothiazolyl, 1,2,3-triazolyl, 1,2,4-triazolyl, oxadiazolyl, furazanyl, thiadiazolyl or tetrazolyl.

[0072] Further examples of heteroaryl include 9- or 10-membered bicyclic ring systems such as indolyl, quinolinyl, benzofuranyl, or benzothienyl.

[0073] More particular heteroaryl groups are selected from isoxazolyl, furyl, thienyl, pyridyl, pyrazolyl, pyrrolyl, indolyl, quinolinyl, benzofuranyl and benzothienyl.

Accordingly ring represented by the group Q.sup.a contains 1 nitrogen heteroatom which is linked to X.sup.1 and optionally contains 1, 2 or 3 additional ring heteroatoms selected from O, S and N. A particular value for Q.sup.a is a non-aromatic 4, 5, 6 or 7 membered monocyclic heterocyclyl group containing 1 nitrogen heteroatom and optionally 1 or 2 further heteroatoms selected from oxygen, nitrogen and sulfur, which heterocyclyl group may be fully saturated or partially saturated and which is nitrogen linked to the group X.sup.1 in Formula I.

[0135] It is to be understood that when, R.sup.1 is a group (1-6C)alkoxy substituted by, for example amino to give for example a 2-aminoethoxy group, it is the (1-6C)alkoxy group that is attached to the quinazoline ring. An analogous convention applies to the other groups defined herein.

[0136] As defined hereinbefore, adjacent carbon atoms in any (2-6C)alkylene chain within, for example, a R.sup.1 substituent may be optionally separated by the insertion into the chain of a group such as O, CON(R.sup.4), N(R.sup.4) or C.ident.C. For example, insertion of a C.ident.C group into the ethylene chain within a 2-morpholinoethoxy group gives rise to a 4-morpholinobut-2-ynyloxy group and, for example, insertion of a CONH group into the ethylene chain within a 3-methoxypropoxy group gives rise to, for example, a 2-(2-methoxyacetamido)ethoxy group. It is to be understood that the term (2-6C)alkylene chain refers to any CH.sub.2CH.sub.2 group (for example within R.sup.1) and includes, for example alkylene chains within a (1-6C)alkyl, (1-6C)alkoxy, (2-8C)alkenyl, (2-8C)alkenyloxy, (2-8C)alkynyl and (2-8C)alkynyloxy group. For example the insertion of a N(CH.sub.3) group between the third and fourth carbon atoms in a hex-5-enyloxy group in R.sup.1 gives rise to a 3-(N-methyl-N-allylamino)propoxy group.

[0137] When, as defined hereinbefore, any CH.sub.2.dbd.CH-- or HC.ident.C-- group within a R.sup.1 substituent optionally bears at the terminal CH.sub.2.dbd. or HC.ident. position a substituent such as a group of the formula Q.sup.4-X.sup.4-- wherein X.sup.4 is, for example, NHCO and Q.sup.4 is a heterocyclyl-(1-6C)alkyl group, suitable R.sup.1 substituents so formed include, for example, N-[heterocyclyl-(1-6C)alkyl]carbamoylvinyl groups such as N-(2-pyrrolidin-1-ylethyl)carbamoylvinyl or N-[heterocyclyl-(1-6C)alkyl]carbamoylethynyl groups such as N-(2-pyrrolidin-1-ylethyl)carbamoylethynyl.

[0138] When reference is made herein to any alkyl or alkylene groups optionally bearing one or more substituents, a CH.sub.2 or CH.sub.3 group within said alkyl or alkylene group optionally bears on each said CH.sub.2 or CH.sub.3 group one or more substituents. There are suitably 1 or 2 substituents present on each said CH.sub.2 group and there are suitably 1, 2 or 3 such substituents present on each said CH.sub.3 group. It is to be understood that the alkyl or alkylene groups which may be substituted include the carbon atoms within cycloalkyl rings and the carbon atoms within composite groups containing an alkyl or alklene chain, such as (1-6C)alkoxy groups. Suitable substituents so formed include, for example, hydroxy-substituted heterocyclyl-(1-6C)alkoxy groups such as 2-hydroxy-3-piperidinopropoxy and 2-hydroxy-3-morpholinopropoxy.

[0139] When reference is made herein to a group (for example a heterocyclyl group) optionally bearing "one or more" substituents the specified group suitably optionally bears 1, 2 or 3 substituents, which may be the same or different.

[0140] It is to be understood that when X.sup.2 is CO, it is a carbonyl group. It is also to be understood that when X.sup.2 is CH.sub.2C(O) or CH.sub.2SO.sub.2, the CH.sub.2 group is attached to Q.sup.a and the carbonyl or sulfonyl group is attached to the nitrogen atom of the NR.sup.20Z group in Formula I.

[0141] When in this specification reference is made to a (1-4C)alkyl group it is to be understood that such groups refer to alkyl groups containing up to 4 carbon atoms. A skilled person will realise that representative examples of such groups are those listed above under (1-6C)alkyl that contain up to 4 carbon atoms, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl and tert-butyl. Similarly, reference to a (1-3C)alkyl group refers to alkyl groups containing up to 3 carbon atoms such as methyl, ethyl, propyl and isopropyl.

[0144] and wherein any heterocyclyl group within a substituent on R.sup.1 is a 4, 5, 6 or 7 membered non-aromatic saturated or partially saturated heterocyclyl group (preferably a 4, 5, 6 or 7 membered monocyclic non-aromatic heterocyclyl group),

[0145] and wherein any heterocyclyl group within a substituent on R.sup.1 optionally bears 1, 2 or 3 substituents, which may be the same or different, selected from halogeno, trifluoromethyl, hydroxy, amino, carbamoyl, (1-6C)alkyl, (2-8C)alkenyl, (2-8C)alkynyl, (1-6C)alkylsulfonyl, (1-6C)alkylamino, di-[(1-6C)alkyl]amino, N-(1-6C)alkylcarbamoyl, N,N-di-[(1-6C)alkyl]carbamoyl, (2-6C)alkanoyl, or from a group of the formula:

[0396] A further aspect the present invention provides a process for preparing a quinazoline derivative of Formula I or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt thereof. It will be appreciated that during certain of the following processes certain substituents may require protection to prevent their undesired reaction. The skilled chemist will appreciate when such protection is required, and how such protecting groups may be put in place, and later removed.

[0397] For examples of protecting groups see one of the many general texts on the subject, for example, `Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis` by Theodora Green (publisher: John Wiley & Sons). Protecting groups may be removed by any convenient method as described in the literature or known to the skilled chemist as appropriate for the removal of the protecting group in question, such methods being chosen so as to effect removal of the protecting group with minimum disturbance of groups elsewhere in the molecule.

[0398] Thus, if reactants include, for example, groups such as amino, carboxy or hydroxy it may be desirable to protect the group in some of the reactions mentioned herein.

[0399] A suitable protecting group for an amino or alkylamino group is, for example, an acyl group, for example an alkanoyl group such as acetyl, an alkoxycarbonyl group, for example a methoxycarbonyl, ethoxycarbonyl or t-butoxycarbonyl group, an arylmethoxycarbonyl group, for example benzyloxycarbonyl, or an aroyl group, for example benzoyl. The deprotection conditions for the above protecting groups necessarily vary with the choice of protecting group. Thus, for example, an acyl group such as an alkanoyl or alkoxycarbonyl group or an aroyl group may be removed for example, by hydrolysis with a suitable base such as an alkali metal hydroxide, for example lithium or sodium hydroxide. Alternatively an acyl group such as a t-butoxycarbonyl group may be removed, for example, by treatment with a suitable acid as hydrochloric, sulfuric or phosphoric acid or trifluoroacetic acid and an arylmethoxycarbonyl group such as a benzyloxycarbonyl group may be removed, for example, by hydrogenation over a catalyst such as palladium-on-carbon, or by treatment with a Lewis acid for example boron tris(trifluoroacetate). A suitable alternative protecting group for a primary amino group is, for example, a phthaloyl group which may be removed by treatment with an alkylamine, for example dimethylaminopropylamine, or with hydrazine.

[0400] A suitable protecting group for a hydroxy group is, for example, an acyl group, for example an alkanoyl group such as acetyl, an aroyl group, for example benzoyl, or an arylmethyl group, for example benzyl. The deprotection conditions for the above protecting groups will necessarily vary with the choice of protecting group. Thus, for example, an acyl group such as an alkanoyl or an aroyl group may be removed, for example, by hydrolysis with a suitable base such as an alkali metal hydroxide, for example lithium, sodium hydroxide or ammonia. Alternatively an arylmethyl group such as a benzyl group may be removed, for example, by hydrogenation over a catalyst such as palladium-on-carbon.

[0401] A suitable protecting group for a carboxy group is, for example, an esterifying group, for example a methyl or an ethyl group which may be removed, for example, by hydrolysis with a base such as sodium hydroxide, or for example a t-butyl group which may be removed, for example, by treatment with an acid, for example an organic acid such as trifluoroacetic acid, or for example a benzyl group which may be removed, for example, by hydrogenation over a catalyst such as palladium-on-carbon. Resins may also be used as a protecting group.

[0402] The protecting groups may be removed at any convenient stage in the synthesis using conventional techniques well known in the chemical art.

[0403] A quinazoline derivative of the Formula I, or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt thereof, may be prepared by any process known to be applicable to the preparation of chemically-related compounds. Such processes, when used to prepare a quinazoline derivative of the Formula I, or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt thereof, are provided as a further feature of the invention and are illustrated by the following representative examples. Necessary starting materials may be obtained by standard procedures of organic chemistry (see, for example, Advanced Organic Chemistry (Wiley-Interscience), Jerry March). The preparation of such starting materials is described within the accompanying non-limiting Examples. Alternatively, necessary starting materials are obtainable by analogous procedures to those illustrated which are within the ordinary skill of an organic chemist. Information on the preparation of necessary starting materials or related compounds (which may be adapted to form necessary starting materials) may also be found in the following Patent and Application Publications, the contents of the relevant process sections of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference: WO94/27965, WO 95/03283, WO 96/33977, WO 96/33978, WO 96/33979, WO 96/33980, WO 96/33981, WO 97/30034, WO 97/38994, WO01/66099, U.S. Pat. No. 5,252,586, EP 520 722, EP 566 226, EP 602 851 and EP 635 507.

[0404] The present invention also provides that quinazoline derivatives of the Formula I, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, can be prepared by a process as follows (wherein the variables are as defined above unless otherwise stated):

[0405] The present invention also provides methods for preparing quinazoline derivatives of the Formula I, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, as outlined below.

[0412] The protecting groups may be removed at any convenient stage in the synthesis using conventional techniques well known in the chemical art.

Reaction Conditions for Process (c)

[0447] The coupling reaction of the acid of formula XX is conveniently carried out in the presence of a suitable coupling agent, such as a carbodiimide, or 1-hydroxybenztriazole or a uronium coupling agent. Suitable uronium coupling agents include, for example O-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-N,N,N',N'-tetramethyluronium hexafluoro-phosphate (HATU) or O-(1H-Benzotriazol-1-yl)-N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl uronium tetrafluoroborate (TBTU). A suitable carbodiimide includes dicyclohexylcarbodiimide or 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide. The reaction is conveniently carried out in the presence of a catalyst such as dimethylaminopyridine or 4-pyrrolidinopyridine.

The reaction is conveniently carried out at a temperature in the range, for example, from -20 to 120.degree. C., conveniently at or near ambient temperature.

[0450] By the term "reactive derivative" of the acid of the formula XX is meant a carboxylic acid derivative that will react with the amine formula XXII to give the corresponding amide. A suitable reactive derivative of a carboxylic acid of the formula XXI is, for example, an acyl halide, for example an acyl chloride formed by the reaction of the acid and an inorganic acid chloride, for example thionyl chloride; a mixed anhydride, for example an anhydride formed by the reaction of the acid and a chloroformate such as an alkyl chloroformate, for example ethyl chloroformate or isobutyl chloroformate; an active ester, for example an ester formed by the reaction of the acid and a phenol such as pentafluorophenol, or N-hydroxybenzotriazole; or an acyl azide, for example an azide formed by the reaction of the acid and azide such as diphenylphosphoryl azide; an acyl cyanide, for example a cyanide formed by the reaction of an acid and a cyanide such as diethylphosphoryl cyanide.

The reaction may conveniently be performed at a temperature as described above.

[0451] Compounds of the formula (XXI) may be prepared by for example reacting a compound of the formula (II) with a compound of the formula (IIIa):

##STR00044##

wherein W, Q.sup.a and q are as defined in relation to Formula I, and provided any functional groups are protected as necessary. The reaction is suitably carried out under analogous conditions to those used in Process (a) herein.

[0452] Compounds of the formulae (IIIa) and (XXII) are known or can be prepared using conventional techniques or analogous processes to those described in the prior art.

Reaction Conditions for Process (d)

[0453] Suitable reductive amination conditions are well known in the art, for example, as described in relation to Process (a) herein. A quinazoline derivative of Formula I, which contains an NH group (for example when Q.sup.a is piperazin-1-yl) is reacted with an appropriate aldehyde to give an optionally substituted ring N(alkyl) group. Appropriate aldehydes will be apparent, for example for the production of those quinazoline derivatives of the Formula I wherein Q.sup.a contains a ring N-methyl group, the corresponding compound containing a ring N--H group may be reacted with formaldehyde in the presence of a suitable reducing agent. Similarly to give an optionally substituted ring N(alkyl) group a suitable aldehyde is the corresponding optionally substituted (2-6C)alkanolaldehyde (for example acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde or (1-4C)alkoxyacetaldehyde such as methoxyacetaldehyde).

[0454] A suitable reducing agent is, for example, a hydride reducing agent, for example formic acid, an alkali metal aluminium hydride such as lithium aluminium hydride, or, suitably, an alkali metal borohydride such as sodium borohydride, sodium cyanoborohydride, sodium triethylborohydride, sodium trimethoxyborohydride and sodium triacetoxyborohydride. The reaction is conveniently performed in a suitable inert solvent or diluent, for example tetrahydrofuran and diethyl ether for the more powerful reducing agents such as lithium aluminium hydride, and, for example, methylene chloride or a protic solvent such as methanol and ethanol for the less powerful reducing agents such as sodium triacetoxyborohydride and sodium cyanoborohydride. The reaction is suitably performed under acidic conditions in the presence of a suitable acid such as hydrogen chloride or acetic acid, a buffer may also be used to maintain pH at the desired level during the reaction. When the reducing agent is formic acid the reaction is conveniently carried out using an aqueous solution of the formic acid. The reaction is performed at a temperature in the range, for example, -10 to 100.degree. C., such as 0 to 50.degree. C., conveniently, at or near ambient temperature.

Reaction conditions for Process (e)

[0455] The cleavage reaction may conveniently be carried out by any of the many procedures known for such a transformation. A particularly suitable cleavage reaction is the treatment of a quinazoline derivative of the Formula I wherein R.sup.1 is a (1-6C)alkoxy group with pyridinium hydrochloride, or an alkali metal halide such as lithium iodide in the presence of 2,4,6-collidine (2,4,6-trimethylpyridine). The reaction may be carried out in the presence of a suitable inert solvent or diluent as defined hereinbefore. The reaction is suitably carried out at a temperature in the range, for example, 10 to 170.degree. C., preferably at elevated temperature for example 120 to 170.degree. C., for example approximately 130.degree. C.

Reaction Conditions for Process (f)

[0456] The coupling reaction is conveniently carried out under Mitsunobu conditions. Suitable Mitsunobu conditions are well known and include, for example, reaction in the presence of a suitable tertiary phosphine and a di-alkylazodicarboxylate in an organic solvent such as THF, or suitably dichloromethane and in the temperature range 0.degree. C. to 100.degree. C., for example 0.degree. C. to 60.degree. C., but suitably at or near ambient temperature. A suitable tertiary phosphine includes for example tri-n-butylphosphine or particularly tri-phenylphosphine. A suitable di-alkylazodicarboxylate includes, for example, diethyl azodicarboxylate (DEAD) or suitably di-tert-butyl azodicarboxylate (DTAD). Details of Mitsunobu reactions are contained in Tet. Letts., 31, 699, (1990); The Mitsunobu Reaction, D. L. Hughes, Organic Reactions, 1992, Vol. 42, 335-656 and Progress in the Mitsunobu Reaction, D. L. Hughes, Organic Preparations and Procedures International, 1996, Vol. 28, 127-164.

[0457] The compound of formula XXIII used as starting material may be prepared by, for example, the cleavage of a quinazoline derivative of the Formula I, wherein R.sup.1 is, for example, methoxy using Process (e) described hereinbefore.

[0458] The quinazoline derivative of the Formula I may be obtained from the above processes in the form of the free base or alternatively it may be obtained in the form of a salt, an acid addition salt. When it is desired to obtain the free base from a salt of the compound of Formula I, the salt may be treated with a suitable base, for example, an alkali or alkaline earth metal carbonate or hydroxide, for example sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, calcium carbonate, sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, or by treatment with ammonia for example using a methanolic ammonia solution such as 7N ammonia in methanol.

[0459] It will be appreciated that certain of the various ring substituents in the compounds of the present invention may be introduced by standard aromatic substitution reactions or generated by conventional functional group modifications either prior to or immediately following the processes mentioned above, and as such are included in the process aspect of the invention. Such reactions and modifications include, for example, introduction of a substituent by means of an aromatic substitution reaction, reduction of substituents, alkylation of substituents and oxidation of substituents. The reagents and reaction conditions for such procedures are well known in the chemical art. Particular examples of aromatic substitution reactions include the introduction of a nitro group using concentrated nitric acid, the introduction of an acyl group using, for example, an acyl halide and Lewis acid (such as aluminium trichloride) under Friedel Crafts conditions; the introduction of an alkyl group using an alkyl halide and Lewis acid (such as aluminium trichloride) under Friedel Crafts conditions; and the introduction of a halogeno group.

[0460] When a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt of a quinazoline derivative of the Formula I is required, for example an acid-addition salt, it may be obtained by, for example, reaction of said quinazoline derivative with a suitable acid using a conventional procedure.

[0461] As mentioned hereinbefore some of the compounds according to the present invention may contain one of more chiral centers and may therefore exist as stereoisomers. Stereoisomers may be separated using conventional techniques, e.g. chromatography or fractional crystallisation. The enantiomers may be isolated by separation of a racemate for example by fractional crystallisation, resolution or HPLC. The diastereoisomers may be isolated by separation by virtue of the different physical properties of the diastereoisomers, for example, by fractional crystallisation, HPLC or flash chromatography. Alternatively particular stereoisomers may be made by chiral synthesis from chiral starting materials under conditions which will not cause racemisation or epimerisation, or by derivatisation, with a chiral reagent. When a specific stereoisomer is isolated it is suitably isolated substantially free for other stereoisomers, for example containing less than 20%, particularly less than 10% and more particularly less than 5% by weight of other stereoisomers.

[0462] In the section above relating to the preparation of the quinazoline derivative of Formula I, the expression "inert solvent" refers to a solvent which does not react with the starting materials, reagents, intermediates or products in a manner which adversely affects the yield of the desired product.

[0463] Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that, in order to obtain compounds of the invention in an alternative and in some occasions, more convenient manner, the individual process steps mentioned hereinbefore may be performed in different order, and/or the individual reactions may be performed at different stage in the overall route (i.e. chemical transformations may be performed upon different intermediates to those associated hereinbefore with a particular reaction).

[0464] Certain novel intermediates utilised in the above processes are provided as a further feature of the present invention together with the process for their preparation. Thus the invention further provides a compound of formula (II), (IV), (V), (VII), (XX) and (XXI) as defined above. In particular in these compounds, the group of sub-formula (i)

##STR00045##

is 3-chloro-2-fluorophenyl or 3-bromo-2-fluorophenyl.

[0465] Compounds of formulae (VI), (VIII), (X) and (IX) are either known compounds or they can be prepared from known compounds by conventional methods.

Biological Assays

[0466] The following assays may be used to measure the effects of the compounds of the present invention as inhibitors of the erb-tyrosine kinases, as inhibitors in-vitro of the proliferation of KB cells (human naso-pharangeal carcinoma cells) and as inhibitors in vivo on the growth in nude mice of xenografts of LoVo tumour cells (colorectal adenocarcinoma).

a) Protein Tyrosine Kinase Phosphorylation Assays

[0467] This test measures the ability of a test compound to inhibit the phosphorylation of a tyrosine containing polypeptide substrate by an EGFR, erbB2 or erbB4 tyrosine kinase enzyme.

[0468] Recombinant intracellular fragments of EGFR, erbB2 and erbB4 (accession numbers X00588, X03363 and L07868 respectively) were cloned and expressed in the baculovirus/Sf21 system. Lysates were prepared from these cells by treatment with ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mM N-2-hydroxyethylpiperizine-N'-2-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) pH7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mM MgCl.sub.2, 1 mM ethylene glycol-bis(.beta.-aminoethyl ether) N',N',N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA), plus protease inhibitors and then cleared by centrifugation.

[0469] Constitutive kinase activity of the recombinant protein was determined by its ability to phosphorylate a synthetic peptide (made up of a random co-polymer of Glutamic Acid, Alanine and Tyrosine in the ratio of 6:3:1). Specifically, Maxisorb.TM. 96-well immunoplates were coated with synthetic peptide (0.2 .mu.g of peptide in a 100 .mu.l phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution and incubated at 4.degree. C. overnight). Plates were washed in PBS-T (phosphate buffered saline with 0.5% Tween 20) then in 50 mM HEPES pH 7.4 at room temperature to remove any excess unbound synthetic peptide. EGFR, ErbB2 or ErbB4 tyrosine kinase activity was assessed by incubation in peptide coated plates for 20 minutes at 22.degree. C. in 100 mM HEPES pH 7.4, adenosine trisphosphate (ATP) at Km concentration for the respective enzyme, 10 mM MnCl.sub.2, 0.1 mM Na.sub.3VO.sub.4, 0.2 mM DL-dithiothreitol (DTI), 0.1% Triton X-100 with test compound in DMSO (final concentration of 2.5%). Reactions were terminated by the removal of the liquid components of the assay followed by washing of the plates with PBS-T.

[0470] The immobilised phospho-peptide product of the reaction was detected by immunological methods. Firstly, plates were incubated for 90 minutes at room temperature with anti-phosphotyrosine primary antibodies that were raised in the mouse (4G10 from Upstate Biotechnology). Following extensive washing, plates were treated with Horseradish Peroxidase (HRP) conjugated sheep anti-mouse secondary antibody (NXA931 from Amersham) for 60 minutes at room temperature. After further washing, HRP activity in each well of the plate was measured calorimetrically using 22'-Azino-di-[3-ethylbenzthiazoline sulfonate (6)] diammonium salt crystals (ABTS.TM. from Roche) as a substrate.

[0471] Quantification of colour development and thus enzyme activity was achieved by the measurement of absorbance at 405 nm on a Molecular Devices ThermoMax microplate reader. Kinase inhibition for a given compound was expressed as an IC.sub.50 value. This was determined by calculation of the concentration of compound that was required to give 50% inhibition of phosphorylation in this assay. The range of phosphorylation was calculated from the positive (vehicle plus ATP) and negative (vehicle minus ATP) control values.

b) EGFR Driven KB Cell Proliferation Assay

[0472] This assay measures the ability of a test compound to inhibit the proliferation of KB cells (human naso-pharangeal carcinoma obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).

[0473] KB cells (human naso-pharangeal carcinoma obtained from the ATCC were cultured in Durbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% foetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamine and non-essential amino acids at 37.degree. C. in a 7.5% CO.sub.2 air incubator. Cells were harvested from the stock flasks using Trypsin/ethylaminediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). Cell density was measured using a haemocytometer and viability was calculated using trypan blue solution before being seeded at a density of 1.25.times.10.sup.3 cells per well of a 96 well plate in DMEM containing 2.5% charcoal stripped serum, 1 mM glutamine and non-essential amino acids at 37.degree. C. in 7.5% CO.sub.2 and allowed to settle for 4 hours.

[0474] Following adhesion to the plate, the cells are treated with or without EGF (final concentration of 1 ng/ml) and with or without compound at a range of concentrations in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) (0.1% final) before incubation for 4 days. Following the incubation period, cell numbers were determined by addition of 50 .mu.l of 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MIN) (stock 5 mg/ml) for 2 hours. MTT solution was then tipped off, the plate gently tapped dry and the cells dissolved upon the addition of 100 .mu.l of DMSO.

[0475] Absorbance of the solubilised cells was read at 540 nm using a Molecular Devices ThermoMax microplate reader. Inhibition of proliferation was expressed as an IC.sub.50 value. This was determined by calculation of the concentration of compound that was required to give 50% inhibition of proliferation. The range of proliferation was calculated from the positive (vehicle plus EGF) and negative (vehicle minus EGF) control values.

c) Clone 24 phospho-erbB2 Cell Assay

[0476] This immunofluorescence end point assay measures the ability of a test compound to inhibit the phosphorylation of erbB2 in a MCF7 (breast carcinoma) derived cell line which was generated by transfecting MCF7 cells with the full length erbB2 gene using standard methods to give a cell line that overexpresses full length wild type erbB2 protein (hereinafter `Clone 24` cells).

[0477] Clone 24 cells were cultured in Growth Medium (phenol red free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% foetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine and 1.2 mg/ml G418) in a 7.5% CO.sub.2 air incubator at 37.degree. C. Cells were harvested from T75 stock flasks by washing once in PBS (phosphate buffered saline, pH7.4, Gibco No. 10010-015) and harvested using 2 mls of Trypsin (1.25 mg/ml)/ethylaminediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) (0.8 mg/ml) solution. The cells were resuspended in Growth Medium. Cell density was measured using a haemocytometer and viability was calculated using Trypan Blue solution before being further diluted in Growth Medium and seeded at a density of 1.times.10.sup.4 cells per well (in 100 ul) into clear bottomed 96 well plates (Packard, No. 6005182).

[0478] 3 days later, Growth Medium was removed from the wells and replaced with 100 ul Assay Medium (phenol red free DMEM, 2 mM glutamine, 1.2 mg/ml G418) either with or without erbB inhibitor compound. Plates were returned to the incubator for 4 hrs and then 20 .mu.l of 20% formaldehyde solution in PBS was added to each well and the plate was left at room temperature for 30 minutes. This fixative solution was removed with a multichannel pipette, 100 .mu.l of PBS was added to each well and then removed with a multichannel pipette and then 50 .mu.l PBS was added to each well. Plates were then sealed and stored for up to 2 weeks at 4.degree. C.

[0479] Immunostaining was performed at room temperature. Wells were washed once with 200 .mu.l PBS/Tween 20 (made by adding 1 sachet of PBS/Tween dry powder (Sigma, No. P3563) to 1 L of double distilled H.sub.2O) using a plate washer then 200 .mu.l Blocking Solution (5% Marvel dried skimmed milk (Nestle) in PBS/Tween 20) was added and incubated for 10 minutes. Blocking Solution was removed using a plate washer and 200 .mu.l of 0.5% Triton X-100/PBS was added to permeabalise the cells. After 10 minutes, the plate was washed with 200 .mu.l PBS/Tween 20 and then 200 .mu.l Blocking Solution was added once again and incubated for 15 minutes. Following removal of the Blocking Solution with a plate washer, 30 .mu.l of rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho ErbB2 IgG antibody (epitope phospho-Tyr 1248, SantaCruz, No. SC-12352-R), diluted 1:250 in Blocking Solution, was added to each well and incubated for 2 hours. Then this primary antibody solution was removed from the wells using a plate washer followed by two 200 .mu.l PBS/Tween 20 washes using a plate washer. Then 30 .mu.l of Alexa-Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, No. A-11008), diluted 1:750 in Blocking Solution, was added to each well. From now onwards, wherever possible, plates were protected from light exposure, at this stage by sealing with black backing tape. The plates were incubated for 45 minutes and then the secondary antibody solution was removed from the wells followed by two 200 .mu.l PBS/Tween 20 washes using a plate washer. Then 100 .mu.l PBS was added to each plate, incubated for 10 minutes and then removed using a plate washer. Then a further 100 .mu.l PBS was added to each plate and then, without prolonged incubation, removed using a plate washer. Then 50 .mu.l of PBS was added to each well and plates were resealed with black backing tape and stored for up to 2 days at 4.degree. C. before analysis.

[0480] The Fluorescence signal is each well was measured using an Acumen Explorer Instrument (Acumen Bioscience Ltd.), a plate reader that can be used to rapidly quantitate features of images generated by laser-scanning. The instrument was set to measure the number of fluorescent objects above a pre-set threshold value and this provided a measure of the phosphorylation status of erbB2 protein. Fluorescence dose response data obtained with each compound was exported into a suitable software package (such as Origin) to perform curve fitting analysis. Inhibition of erbB2 phosphorylation was expressed as an IC.sub.50 value. This was determined by calculation of the concentration of compound that was required to give 50% inhibition of erbB2 phosphorylation signal.

d) In Vivo Xenograft Assay

[0481] This assay measures the ability of a test compound to inhibit the growth of a LoVo tumour (colorectal adenocarcinoma obtained from the ATCC) in Female Swiss athymic mice (Alderley Park, nu/nu genotype).

[0482] Female Swiss athymic (nu/nu genotype) mice were bred and maintained in Alderley Park in negative pressure Isolators (PFI Systems Ltd.). Mice were housed in a barrier facility with 12 hr light/dark cycles and provided with sterilised food and water ad libitum. All procedures were performed on mice of at least 8 weeks of age. LoVo tumour cell (colorectal adenocarcinoma obtained from the ATCC) xenografts were established in the hind flank of donor mice by sub cutaneous injections of 1.times.10.sup.7 freshly cultured cells in 100 .mu.l of serum free media per animal. On day 5 post-implant, mice were randomised into groups of 7 prior to the treatment with compound or vehicle control that was administered once daily at 0.1 ml/10 g body weight. Tumour volume was assessed twice weekly by bilateral Vernier calliper measurement, using the formula (length.times.width).times. (length.times.width).times.(.pi./6), where length was the longest diameter across the tumour, and width was the corresponding perpendicular. Growth inhibition from start of study was calculated by comparison of the mean changes in tumour volume for the control and treated groups, and statistical significance between the two groups was evaluated using a Students t test.

e) hERG-Encoded Potassium Channel Inhibition Assay

[0483] This assay determines the ability of a test compound to inhibit the tail current flowing through the human ether-a-go-go-related-gene (hERG)-encoded potassium channel.

[0484] Human embryonic kidney (BEK) cells expressing the hERG-encoded channel were grown in Minimum Essential Medium Eagle (EMEM; Sigma-Aldrich catalogue number M2279), supplemented with 10% Foetal Calf Serum (Labtech International; product number 4-101-500), 10% Ml serum-free supplement (Egg Technologies; product number 70916) and 0.4 mg/ml Geneticin G418 (Sigma-Aldrich; catalogue number G7034). One or two days before each experiment, the cells were detached from the tissue culture flasks with Accutase (TCS Biologicals) using standard tissue culture methods. They were then put onto glass coverslips resting in wells of a 12 well plate and covered with 2 ml of the growing media.

[0485] For each cell recorded, a glass coverslip containing the cells was placed at the bottom of a Perspex chamber containing bath solution (see below) at room temperature (.about.20.degree. C.). This chamber was fixed to the stage of an inverted, phase-contrast microscope. Immediately after placing the coverslip in the chamber, bath solution was perfused into the chamber from a gravity-fed reservoir for 2 minutes at a rate of .about.2 ml/min. After this time, perfusion was stopped.

[0486] A patch pipette made from borosilicate glass tubing (GC120F, Harvard Apparatus) using a P-97 micropipette puller (Sutter Instrument Co.) was filled with pipette solution (see hereinafter). The pipette was connected to the headstage of the patch clamp amplifier (Axopatch 200B, Axon Instruments) via a silver/silver chloride wire. The headstage ground was connected to the earth electrode. This consisted of a silver/silver chloride wire embedded in 3% agar made up with 0.85% sodium chloride.

[0487] The cell was recorded in the whole cell configuration of the patch clamp technique. Following "break-in", which was done at a holding potential of -80 mV (set by the amplifier), and appropriate adjustment of series resistance and capacitance controls, electrophysiology software (Clampex, Axon Instruments) was used to set a holding potential (-80 mV) and to deliver a voltage protocol. This protocol was applied every 15 seconds and consisted of a 1 s step to +40 mV followed by a 1 s step to -50 mV. The current response to each imposed voltage protocol was low pass filtered by the amplifier at 1 kHz. The filtered signal was then acquired, on line, by digitising this analogue signal from the amplifier with an analogue to digital converter. The digitised signal was then captured on a computer running Clampex software (Axon Instruments). During the holding potential and the step to +40 mV the current was sampled at 1 kHz. The sampling rate was then set to 5 kHz for the remainder of the voltage protocol.

[0488] The compositions, pH and osmolarity of the bath and pipette solution are tabulated below.

TABLE-US-00003 Salt Pipette (mM) Bath (mM) NaCl -- 137 KCl 130 4 MgCl.sub.2 1 1 CaCl.sub.2 -- 1.8 HEPES 10 10 glucose -- 10 Na.sub.2ATP 5 -- EGTA 5 -- Parameter Pipette Bath pH 7.18-7.22 7.40 pH adjustment with 1M KOH 1M NaOH Osmolarity (mOsm) 275-285 285-295

[0489] The amplitude of the hERG-encoded potassium channel tail current following the step from +40 mV to -50 mV was recorded on-line by Clampex software (Axon Instruments). Following stabilisation of the tail current amplitude, bath solution containing the vehicle for the test substance was applied to the cell. Providing the vehicle application had no significant effect on tail current amplitude, a cumulative concentration effect curve to the compound was then constructed.

[0490] The effect of each concentration of test compound was quantified by expressing the tail current amplitude in the presence of a given concentration of test compound as a percentage of that in the presence of vehicle.

[0491] Test compound potency (IC.sub.50) was determined by fitting the percentage inhibition values making up the concentration-effect to a four parameter Hill equation using a standard data-fitting package. If the level of inhibition seen at the highest test concentration did not exceed 50%, no potency value was produced and a percentage inhibition value at that concentration was quoted.

[0492] Although the pharmacological properties of the compounds of the Formula I vary with structural change as expected, in general activity possessed by compounds of the Formula I, may be demonstrated at the following concentrations or doses in one or more of the above tests (a), (b) and (c):--

[0493] Test (a):--IC.sub.50 (for EGFR) in the range, for example, 0.001-10 .mu.M;

[0494] Test (b):--IC.sub.50 in the range, for example, 0.001-10 .mu.M;

[0495] Test (c):--IC.sub.50 in the range, for example, 0.01-10 .mu.M;

[0496] Test (d):--activity in the range, for example, 1-200 mg/kg/day.

[0497] By way of example, using Test (a) (for the inhibition of EGFR tyrosine kinase protein phosphorylation) and Test (b), the KB cell assay described above, representative compounds described in the Examples herein gave the IC.sub.50 results shown below in Table A:

TABLE-US-00004 TABLE A IC.sub.50 (nM) Test (a) (Inhibition of EGFR IC.sub.50 (nM) Test (b) tyrosine kinase protein (EGFR driven KB cell Compound of Example phosphorylation) proliferation assay) 20 64 143 24 20 50 37 67 160 41 52 290

[0498] According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a pharmaceutical composition which comprises a quinazoline derivative of the Formula I, or a pharmaceutically-acceptable thereof, as defined hereinbefore in association with a pharmaceutically-acceptable diluent or carrier.

[0499] The compositions of the invention may be in a form suitable for oral use (for example as tablets, lozenges, hard or soft capsules, aqueous or oily suspensions, emulsions, dispersible powders or granules, syrups or elixirs), for topical use (for example as creams, ointments, gels, or aqueous or oily solutions or suspensions), for administration by inhalation (for example as a finely divided powder or a liquid aerosol), for administration by insufflation (for example as a finely divided powder) or for parenteral administration (for example as a sterile aqueous or oily solution for intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular or intramuscular dosing or as a suppository for rectal dosing).

[0500] The compositions of the invention may be obtained by conventional procedures using conventional pharmaceutical excipients, well known in the art. Thus, compositions intended for oral use may contain, for example, one or more colouring, sweetening, flavouring and/or preservative agents.

[0501] The amount of active ingredient that is combined with one or more excipients to produce a single dosage form will necessarily vary depending upon the host treated and the particular route of administration. For example, a formulation intended for oral administration to humans will generally contain, for example, from 0.5 mg to 0.5 g of active agent (more suitably from 0.5 to 100 mg, for example from 1 to 30 mg) compounded with an appropriate and convenient amount of excipients which may vary from about 5 to about 98 percent by weight of the total composition.

[0502] The size of the dose for therapeutic or prophylactic purposes of a compound of the Formula I will naturally vary according to the nature and severity of the conditions, the age and sex of the animal or patient and the route of administration, according to well known principles of medicine.

[0503] In using a compound of the Formula I for therapeutic or prophylactic purposes it will generally be administered so that a daily dose in the range, for example, 0.1 mg/kg to 75 mg/kg body weight is received, given if required in divided doses. In general lower doses will be administered when a parenteral route is employed. Thus, for example, for intravenous administration, a dose in the range, for example, 0.1 mg/kg to 30 mg/kg body weight will generally be used. Similarly, for administration by inhalation, a dose in the range, for example, 0.05 mg/kg to 25 mg/kg body weight will be used. Oral administration is however preferred, particularly in tablet form. Typically, unit dosage forms will contain about 0.5 mg to 0.5 g of a compound of this invention.

[0504] We have found that the compounds of the present invention possess anti-proliferative properties such as anti-cancer properties that are believed to arise from their erbB family receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitory activity, particularly inhibition of the EGF receptor (erbB1) tyrosine kinase. Furthermore, certain of the compounds according to the present invention possess substantially better potency against the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase, than against other tyrosine kinase enzymes, for example erbB2, VEGF or KDR receptor tyrosine kinases. Such compounds possess sufficient potency against the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase that they may be used in an amount sufficient to inhibit EGF receptor tyrosine kinase whilst demonstrating little, or significantly lower, activity against other tyrosine kinase enzymes such as erbB2. Such compounds are likely to be useful for the selective inhibition of EGF receptor tyrosine kinase and are likely to be useful for the effective treatment of, for example EGF driven tumours.

[0505] Accordingly, the compounds of the present invention are expected to be useful in the treatment of diseases or medical conditions mediated alone or in part by erbB receptor tyrosine kinases (especially EGF receptor tyrosine kinase), i.e. the compounds may be used to produce an erbB receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitory effect in a warm-blooded animal in need of such treatment. Thus the compounds of the present invention provide a method for the treatment of malignant cells characterised by inhibition of one or more of the erbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases. Particularly the compounds of the invention may be used to produce an anti-proliferative and/or pro-apoptotic and/or anti-invasive effect mediated alone or in part by the inhibition of erbB receptor tyrosine kinases. Particularly, the compounds of the present invention are expected to be useful in the prevention or treatment of those tumours that are sensitive to inhibition of one or more of the erbB receptor tyrosine kinases, such as EGF and/or erbB2 and/or erbB4 receptor tyrosine kinases (especially EGF receptor tyrosine kinase) that are involved in the signal transduction steps which drive proliferation and survival of these tumour cells. Accordingly the compounds of the present invention are expected to be useful in the treatment of psoriasis, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), atherosclerosis and restenosis and/or cancer by providing an anti-proliferative effect, particularly in the treatment of erbB receptor tyrosine kinase sensitive cancers. Such benign or malignant tumours may affect any tissue and include non-solid tumours such as leukaemia, multiple myeloma or lymphoma, and also solid tumours, for example bile duct, bone, bladder, brain/CNS, breast, colorectal, endometrial, gastric, head and neck, hepatic, lung, neuronal, oesophageal, ovarian, pancreatic, prostate, renal, skin, testicular, thyroid, uterine and vulval cancers.

[0519] By "a selective EGFR kinase inhibitory effect" is meant that the quinazoline derivative of Formula I is more potent against EGF receptor tyrosine kinase than it is against other kinases. In particular some of the compounds according to the invention are more potent against EGF receptor kinase than against other tyrosine kinases such as other erbB receptor tyrosine kinases such erbB2. For example a selective EGFR kinase inhibitor according to the invention is at least 5 times, preferably at least 10 times more potent against EGF receptor tyrosine kinase than it is against erbB2 tyrosine kinase, as determined from the relative IC.sub.50 values in suitable assays. For example, by comparing the IC.sub.50 value from the KB cell assay (a measure of the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitory activity) with the IC.sub.50 value from the Clone 24 phospho-erbB2 cell assay (a measure of erb-B2 tyrosine kinase inhibitory activity) for a given test compound as described above.

[0523] As mentioned above the size of the dose required for the therapeutic or prophylactic treatment of a particular disease will necessarily be varied depending upon, amongst other things, the host treated, the route of administration and the severity of the illness being treated.

[0527] Although the compounds of the Formula I are primarily of value as therapeutic agents for use in warm-blooded animals (including man), they are also useful whenever it is required to inhibit the effects of the erbB receptor tyrosine protein kinases. Thus, they are useful as pharmacological standards for use in the development of new biological tests and in the search for new pharmacological agents.

EXAMPLE 1

1-({4-[(3-Chloro-2-fluorophenyl)amino]-7-methoxyquinazolin-6-yl}methyl)-L-- proilnamide (Compound No 2 in Table 1)

(Process (a))

[0539] Sodium triacetoxy borohydride (624 mg) was added to a stirred suspension of 4-(3-chloro-2-fluoroanilino)-6-carbaldehyde-7-methoxy quinazoline (650 mg) and L-prolinamide (246 mg) in THF (5 mL) at ambient temperature under a nitrogen atmosphere. After 18 hours the reaction mixture was filtered and evaporated under reduced pressure. The residues were partitioned between saturated sodium bicarbonate solution and methylene chloride. The organics were dried (MgSO.sub.4), filtered and evaporated.
