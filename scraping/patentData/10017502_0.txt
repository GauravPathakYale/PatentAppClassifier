Description


TECHNICAL FIELD

The technical field relates to certain derivatives of benzoxazinone amides (including pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof) that act as mineralocorticoid (MR) receptor modulators that may reduce oxidative stress in endothelium and hence improve vascular function, to their utility in potentially treating and/or preventing clinical conditions including cardiovascular and metabolic diseases such as hypertension, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, diabetic nephropathy, diabetes, disorders of the ocular vasculature, to methods for their potential therapeutic use, to pharmaceutical compositions containing them and to processes for preparing such compounds.

BACKGROUND

Aldosterone, a physiological mineralocorticoid, regulates sodium transport in epithelial tissues, particularly the distal nephron and colon. The response to aldosterone is mediated by a nuclear receptor, the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR; NR3C2) and involves non-genomic as well as genomic effects. The pivotal role of the MR in the mineralocorticoid response is demonstrated in MR null mice; these mice exhibit profound mineralocorticoid-unresponsive salt-wasting, which is inevitably fatal in the early neonatal period. Compromised mineralocorticoid action is associated with salt balance disorders and hyperaldosteroidism is associated with endothelial dysfunction and impaired vascular reactivity in patients with hypertension or congestive heart failure. MR antagonism is coupled to reduced oxidative stress in endothelium and hence improved vascular function.

High levels of circulating aldosterone are associated with endothelial dysfunction in hypertensives and patients with congestive heart failure, effects that are principally mediated by the mineralocorticoid receptor. Prolonged hyperaldosteronism is also associated with kidney fibrosis and eventually failure (Trends Endocrinol Metab. 2008, 19(3)), 88-90). Blockade of MR in heart failure studies led to substantial reductions in mortality and morbidity, despite dosing being limited by MR mediated hyperkalemia (N. Engl. J. Med. 1999, 341(10), 709-17). Limited clinical trials have demonstrated beneficial effects of MR antagonists also in treatment of kidney disease including diabetic nephropathy (Kidney International 2011, 79, 1051). However, the risk for hyperkalemia is currently limiting the use of MR antagonists and particularly excludes diabetic patients. Novel, potent and selective MR antagonists should increase this therapeutic window between endothelial improvements and hyperkalemia of epithelial origin.

Chem. 2014, 57(10), 4273 describe the efforts to improve nuclear hormone receptor selectivity of PF-03882845.

Despite the foregoing, there still exists a need for alternative/further improved agents for treatment of cardiovascular, inflammatory, metabolic and renal conditions, including heart failure, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, diabetic nephropathy, endothelial dysfunction, diabetes, disorders of the ocular vasculature, having, for example, the advantage that they may be more efficacious, be less toxic, be more selective, be more potent, produce fewer side effects, be more easily absorbed, and/or have a better pharmacokinetic profile (e.g. higher oral bioavailability and/or lower clearance), than compounds previously described.

A further embodiment encompasses pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of formula (I).

A salt of a compound of formula (I) may be advantageous due to one or more of its chemical or physical properties, such as stability in differing temperatures and humidities, or a desirable solubility in H.sub.2O, oil, or other solvent. In some instances, a salt may be used to aid in the isolation or purification of the compound. In some embodiments (particularly where the salt is intended for administration to an animal, e.g. a human, or is a reagent for use in making a compound or salt intended for administration to an animal), the salt is pharmaceutically acceptable.

The term "pharmaceutically acceptable" is used to characterize a moiety (e.g. a salt, dosage form, or excipient) as being appropriate for use in accordance with sound medical judgment. In general, a pharmaceutically acceptable moiety has one or more benefits that outweigh any deleterious effect that the moiety may have. Deleterious effects may include, for example, excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, and other problems and complications.

Where the compound is sufficiently acidic, pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not limited to, an alkali metal salt, e.g. Na or K, an alkali earth metal salt, e.g. Ca or Mg, or an organic amine salt. Where the compound is sufficiently basic, pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not limited to, inorganic or organic acid addition salts.

There may be more than one cation or anion depending on the number of charged functions and the valency of the cations or anions.

For reviews on suitable salts, see Berge et al., J. Pharm. Sci., 1977, 66, 1-19 or Handbook of Pharmaceutical Salts: Properties, selection and use, P. H. Stahl, P. G. Vermuth, IUPAC, Wiley-VCH, 2002.

Where an acid or base co-former is a solid at rt and there is no or only partial proton transfer between the compound of formula (I) and such an acid or base co-former, a co-crystal of the co-former and compound of formula (I) may result rather than a salt. All such co-crystal forms of the compound of formula (I) are encompassed herein.

It is also to be understood that certain compounds of formula (I) may exist in solvated form, e.g. hydrates, including solvates of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of a compound of formula (I).

In a further embodiment, certain compounds of formula (I) may exist as racemates and racemic mixtures, single enantiomers, individual diastereomers and diastereomeric mixtures. Certain compounds of formula (I) may also contain linkages (e.g. carbon-carbon bonds, carbon-nitrogen bonds such as amide bonds) wherein bond rotation is restricted about that particular linkage, e.g. restriction resulting from the presence of a ring bond or double bond. Stereoisomers may be separated using conventional techniques, e.g. chromatography or fractional crystallization, or the stereoisomers may be made by stereoselective synthesis.

In a further embodiment, the compounds of formula (I) encompass any isotopically-labelled (or "radio-labelled") derivatives of a compound of formula (I). Such a derivative is a derivative of a compound of formula (I) wherein one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number typically found in nature. Examples of radionuclides that may be incorporated include .sup.2H (also written as "D" for deuterium).

In a further embodiment, the compounds of formula (I) may be administered in the form of a prodrug which is broken down in the human or animal body to give a compound of the formula (I). Examples of prodrugs include in vivo hydrolysable esters of a compound of the formula (I).

An in vivo hydrolysable (or cleavable) ester of a compound of the formula (I) that contains a carboxy or a hydroxy group is, for example, a pharmaceutically acceptable ester which is hydrolyzed in the human or animal body to produce the parent acid or alcohol. For examples of ester prodrugs derivatives, see: Curr. Drug. Metab. 2003, 4, 461.

Various other forms of prodrugs are known in the art. For examples of prodrug derivatives, see: Nature Reviews Drug Discovery 2008, 7, 255 and references cited therein.

C. Mass spectra were recorded on either Waters ZQ single quadropole or Waters 3100 single quadropole both equipped with a pneumatically assisted electrospray interface.

The X-ray diffraction analysis was performed according to standard methods, which may be found in, e.g., A. I. Kitaigorodsky (1973), Molecular Crystals and Molecules, Academic Press, New York; C. W. Bunn (1948), Chemical Crystallography, Clarendon Press, London; or H. P. Klug and L. E. Alexander (1974), X-ray Diffraction Procedures, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York. X-ray powder diffraction data was measured with Corundum as an internal reference. The X-ray powder diffraction (referred to herein as XRPD) pattern was determined by mounting a sample on a zero background holder, single silicon crystal, and spreading out the sample into a thin layer. The powder X-ray diffraction was recorded with a Theta-Theta PANalytical X'Pert PRO (wavelength of X-rays 1.5418 .ANG. nickel-filtered Cu radiation, Voltage 45 kV, filament emission 40 mA). Automatic variable divergence and anitscatter slits were used and the samples were rotated during measurement. Samples were scanned from 2-50.degree. 2 Theta using a 0.013.degree. step width and a 44.37 s count time, together with a PIXCEL detector (active length 3.35.degree. 2 Theta). The X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) pattern was obtained in Bragg-Brentano geometry. It is known that an X-ray powder diffraction pattern may be obtained which has one or more measurement errors depending on measurement conditions, such as equipment or machine used (Jenkins, R & Snyder, R. L. Introduction to X-Ray Powder Diffractometry John Wiley & Sons 1996; Bunn, C. W. (1948), Chemical Crystallography, Clarendon Press, London; Klug, H. P. & Alexander, L. E. (1974), X-Ray Diffraction Procedures). Persons skilled in the art of X-ray powder diffraction will realize that the relative intensity of peaks can be affected by, for example, grains above 30 microns in size and non-unitary aspect ratios that may affect analysis of samples. Furthermore, it should be understood that intensities might fluctuate depending on experimental conditions and sample preparation (e.g. preferred orientation). The following definitions have been used for the relative intensity (%): 25-100%, vs (very strong); 10-25%, s (strong); 3-10%, m (medium); 1-3%, w (weak). The skilled person will also realize that the position of reflections can be affected by the precise height at which the sample sits in the diffractometer and the zero calibration of the diffractometer. The surface planarity of the sample may also have a small effect. Hence the diffraction pattern data presented are not to be taken as absolute values. Generally, a measurement error of a diffraction angle in an X-ray powder diffractogram may be approximately plus or minus 0.2.degree. 2-theta, and such a degree of a measurement error should be taken into account when considering the X-ray powder diffraction data. Optical rotation was determined using a Perkin Elmer 341. The specific optical rotation is reported as [.alpha.].sub.D.sup.20 (solvent, c=1) wherein c=1 means 10 mg/mL and [.alpha.].sub.D.sup.20 means the optical rotation was determined at 20.degree. C. using the Na line.

Several methods for determination of absolute configuration of chiral centres in small organic compounds are commonly used, including single crystal X-ray diffraction, NMR combined with chiral derivatisation, structural proof based on synthetic transformations, optical rotation and ECD. A more recent method is VCD that can be applied to most pharmaceuticals with reasonable size and flexibility. It relies on comparison of an experimental and a computed spectrum where the latter is an average of individual spectra of all low-energy conformers of the molecule according to the Boltzmann distribution. The method can be very fast since the spectra are acquired in solution. In cases where a single crystal is difficult and time consuming to obtain, it is particularly valuable. Many examples have been published, also applied to druglike compounds (Appl. Spectrosc. 2011, 65, 699, Org. Biomol. Chem., 2012, 10, 4208, Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2013, 14, 4019, J. Med.

The absolute configuration was determined using VCD by first dissolving 15 mg of the solid material in 140-150 .mu.l CDCl.sub.3 for each sample. The solutions were then transferred to 0.100 mm BaF2 cells and the VCD spectra were acquired for six h each in a BioTools ChiralIR instrument equipped with dual source and dual photoelastic modulator. The resolution was 4 cm.sup.-1. A Monte Carlo molecular mechanics search for low energy geometries was conducted for slightly truncated structures (methyl ester was used instead of ethyl ester) of the two enantiomers, R and S. MacroModel within the Maestro graphical interface (Schrodinger Inc.) was used to generate starting coordinates for conformers. All conformers within 5 kcal/mole of the lowest energy conformer were used as starting points for density functional theory (DFT) minimizations within Gaussian09. Optimized structures, harmonic vibrational frequencies/intensities, VCD rotational strengths, and free energies at STP (including zero-point energies) were determined for each conformer. In these calculations, the functional B3LYP and the basis set 6-31G* were used. Simulations of infrared and VCD spectra for each conformation were generated using an in-house built program to fit Lorentzian line shapes (12 cm.sup.-1 line width) to the computed spectra thereby allowing direct comparisons between simulated and experimental spectra.

The experimental VCD spectra of Intermediate 20a and Intermediate 20b obtained in CDCl.sub.3 were compared with the simulated spectra of the two enantiomers. The comparison demonstrates that Intermediate 20a is the S enantiomer and Intermediate 20b has R configuration. Most major bands confirm this interpretation.

The absolute configurations of Intermediate 27a and 27b were determined by recording and comparing VCD for the two enantiomers with those calculated for the corresponding methyl esters (to reduce the number of computational conformations). Intermediate 27a (16.9 mg) was dissolved in 170 .mu.L CDCl.sub.3. Intermediate 27b (14.9 mg) was dissolved in 150 .mu.L CDCl.sub.3. The solutions were transferred to 0.100 mm BaF2 cells and the VCD spectra were acquired for seven hours each in a BioTools ChiralIR instrument equipped with dual source and dual photoelastic modulator. The resolution was 4 cm.sup.-1.

A Monte Carlo molecular mechanics search for low energy geometries was conducted for slightly truncated structures (methyl ester was used instead of ethyl ester) of the two enantiomers, R and S. The structures used for the simulations are shown in FIG. 3. MacroModel within the Maestro graphical interface (Schrodinger Inc.) was used to generate starting coordinates for conformers. All conformers within 5 kcal/mole of the lowest energy conformer were used as starting points for density functional theory (DFT) minimizations within Gaussian09. Optimized structures, harmonic vibrational frequencies/intensities, VCD rotational strengths, and free energies at STP (including zero-point energies) were determined for each conformer. In these calculations, the functional B3LYP and the basis set 6-31G* were used. Simulations of infrared and VCD spectra for each conformation were generated using an in-house built program to fit Lorentzian line shapes (12 cm-1 line width) to the computed spectra thereby allowing direct comparisons between simulated and experimental spectra. The experimental spectra of the two samples were compared with the simulated spectra of the two methyl ester enantiomers. The agreement between the experimental and simulated spectra was good and Intermediate 27a can unambiguously be assigned as the S enantiomer and Intermediate 27b as the R isomer.

Pharmacological Activity

The following test procedures may be employed

Mineralocorticoid Binding, Test A

In order to identify binding to the human MR LBD a scintillation proximity assay (SPA) was adapted to the 384-well format. The MR-LBD (amino acids T729-K985) was expressed as N-terminal fusion with maltose binding protein in Hi5 insect cells by co-infection with recombinant MBP-MR LBD and P23 baculoviruses and crude protein lysate was used in the assay. Tritiated aldosterone is used as the ligand to generate the scintillation signal when brought into proximity of the scintillation (SPA) bead by binding to the MR LBD and test compound affinity (in IC.sub.50 values) is defined as the concentration to decrease tritiated aldosterone binding to the MR LBD by 50%.

Briefly, in Test A1 the assay was run in 384 well format in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mM EDTA 20 mM NaMoO.sub.4, 0.1 mM DTT and 10% glycerol at rt. Compounds were tested in a 7 (Test A1) or 10 (Test A2) concentration response curve ranging from 10 nM to 10 .mu.M (Test A1) or 1 nM to 37 .mu.M (Test A2). Compounds were spotted at the bottom of a well of a 384-well PE Opti-Plate to yield final DMSO concentrations in the assay of 2%. Pre-made MBP-MR/P23 lysate: .sup.3H-aldosterone mix (final assay concentration 7 .mu.g/mL MBP-MR LBD/P23 lysate; 5 nM aldosterone) was added onto the top of the spotted compound and preincubated for 1 h at RT. After 1 h an equal volume anti-rabbit SPA beads (Test A1) or Imaging beads (Test A2) coupled with rabbit anti-MBP were added to the assay mixture and incubated for 3 hrs (Test A1) or >8 h (Test A2) at rt. The inhibition of the scintillation signal by displacement of the bound .sup.3H-aldosterone by test compounds is measured by scintillation counting using a Microbeta Trilux (Wallac) (Test A1) or a by CCD camera detection using a LEADseeker (PerkinElmer) (Test A2).

Mineralocorticoid Cellular Reporter Gene Assay, Test B

To test for potency and efficacy of compounds, 25000 cells from a freshly thawed batch of cryopreserved UAS-MR-bla HEK293 cells (Invitrogen, K1696), were added to each well in a 384 well plate using a Multidrop. Cells were grown in 30 .mu.l DMEM without phenol red (Invitrogen 21063-029) containing 2% charcoal stripped fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen 12676-029), Penicillin/Streptomycin, Non-essential amino acids and sodium pyruvate according to the Invitrogens protocoll included with the cells. Upon seeding, the plates were incubated at 37.degree. C., 5% CO2, for 4 h to allow cells to adhere. From a plate containing compound dilution series in DMSO, typically spanning 10 concentrations (10 .mu.M to 0.5 nM final concentration), 0.6 .mu.L compound per well was added using a Beckman FX pipetter. The plates were incubated for 30 min prior to addition of aldosterone to a final concentration of 0.25 nM (Test B1) or 1 nM (Test B2). Following 16-20 h incubation, beta-lactamase activity was assessed by addition of 8 .mu.L of a CCF4 containing substrate buffer prepared according to Invitrogens protocoll included with the cells. Plates were left for 2 h in the dark before fluorescence was measured in a Pherastar FS with bottom reading and filters set to excitation at 409 nm and emission collection at 460 and 530 nm. After background subtraction, the 460/530 ratio was calculated for each assay point and averaged from three parallel assay plates. 0% inhibition was defined by wells that only contain aldosterone, 100% inhibition was defined by wells containing 120 nM spironolactone.

The concentration and percent activation of the Test compound is fitted using a Sigmoidal Dose-Response Model where the EC.sub.50 is determined as the concentration of the Test compound at the midpoint of the dose-response curve. Equation: fit=(A+((B-A)/(1+((C/x)^D)))) where, A=curve bottom, B=curve top, C=EC.sub.50, D=slope (Hill coefficient) and x=concentration of Test compound.
