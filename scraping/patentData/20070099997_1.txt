Description


FIELD OF THE INVENTION

[0001] The present invention relates to certain novel salts of (-)-2-{[2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethyl]thio}-3-[4-(2-f{4[(methylsulfonyl)oxy]ph- enoxy}ethyl)phenyl]-propanoic acid, particularly a potassium and a sodium salt thereof, to processes for preparing such compounds, to their the utility in treating clinical conditions including lipid disorders (dyslipidemias) whether or not associated with insulin resistance and other manifestations of the metabolic syndrome, to methods for their therapeutic use and to pharmaceutical compositions containing them

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

[0002] The metabolic syndrome including type 2 diabetes mellitus, refers to a cluster of manifestations including insulin resistance with accompanying hyperinsulinaemia, possibly type 2 diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension, central (visceral) obesity, dyslipidaemia observed as deranged lipoprotein levels typically characterised by elevated VIDL (very low density lipoproteins), small dense LIDL particles and reduced HDL (high density lipoprotein) concentrations and reduced fibrinolysis.

[0003] Recent epidemiological research has documented that individuals with insulin resistance run a greatly increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, notably suffering from myocardial infarction and stroke. In type 2 diabetes mellitus atherosclerosis related conditions cause up to 80% of all deaths.

[0004] In clinical medicine there is awareness of the need to increase the insulin sensitivity in patients with the metabolic syndrome and hus to correct the dyslipidaemia which is considered to cause the accelerated progress of atherosclerosis. However, currently this is not a universally accepted diagnosis with well-defmed phanmcotherapeutic indications.

[0005] Co-pending PCI application No. PCT/GB02/05743 discloses compounds of formula A ##STR1## wherein R.sup.1 represents chloro, fluoro or hydroxy as well as optical isomers and racemates thereof as well as pharmaceutically acceptable salts, prodrugs, solvates and crystallie forms thereof which are selective PPAR.alpha. modulators (for a review of the PPARs (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors ) see T. M. Willson et al J Med Chem 2000, Vol 43, 527). These compounds are effective in treating conditions associated with insulin resistance. Specific pharmaceutically-acceptable salts of compounds of the formula A are not disclosed in PCT/GB02/05743. Further, no information is provided in relation to how crystalline forms of compounds of the formula A, and particularly salts thereof, may be prepared. The (-) enantiomer of the compound in which R.sup.1 represents hydroxy is prepared as the free acid in this application. However, this compound is a thick oil with a syruplike consistency and is thus not suitable for use in pharmaceutical formulations since it is not mobile. Therefore there exists a need for a solid derivative of this compound which has physical and chemical properties suitable for use in pharmaceutical fonn tons. Many salts were tried but most of these either could not be formed in the solid state or were amorphous with a low glass transition temperature. Salts with suitable propertes for pharmaceutical formulation have now been found.

[0006] In the formulation of drug compositions, it is important for the drug substance to be in a form in which it can be conveniently handled and processed. This is of importance, not only from the point of view of obtamin a commercially-viable manufacturing process, but also from the point of view of subsequent manufacture of pharmaceutical formulations comprising the active compound

[0007] Further, in the manufacture of drug compositions, it is important that a reliable, reproducible and constant plasma concentration profile of drug is provided following administration to a patient.

[0008] Chemical stability, solid state stability, and "shelf life" of the active ingredients are also very important factors. The drag substance, and compositions containing it, should preferably be capable of being effectively stored over appreciable periods of time, without exhibiting a significant change in the active component's physico-chemical characteristics (e.g. its chemical composition, density, hygroscopicity and solubilhy).

[0009] Moreover, it is also important to be able to providethe drugin a form which is as chemically pure as possible.

[0010] The skilled person will appreciate that, typically, if a drug can be readily obtained in a stable form, such as a stable crystalline form, advantages may be provided, in terms of ease of handling, ease of preparation of suitable pharmaceutical formulations, and a more reliable solubility profile.

DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

[0011] The present invention provides a potassium salt or a sodium salt of (-)-2-{([2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethyl]thio}-3-[4-(2-{4[(methylsulfonyl)oxy- ]phenoxy}ethyl)phenyl]-propanoic acid

[0012] According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a compound of the invention in substantially crystalline form.

[0013] It is possible to produce compounds of the invention in forms which are greater than 80% crystalline, by "substantially crystalline" but also included are forms greater than 20%, preferably greater than 30%, and more preferably greater than 40% (e.g. greater than any of 50, 60, 70, 80 or 90%) crystallme.

[0014] According to a ihther aspect of the invention there is also provided a compound of the invention in partially crystalline form By "partially crystalline" we include 5% or between 5% and 20% crystalline.

[0015] The degree (%) of crystalnnity may be determined by the skilled person using X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD). Other techniques, such as solid state NMR, Fr-IR, Raman spectroscopy, differential scaiin g calorimetry (D)SC) and microcalorimetry, may also be used.

[0016] Compounds of the invention, and particularly crystalline compunds of the invention, may have inproved stability when compared to compounds disclosed in PCT/GB02/05743.

[0017] The term "stability" as defined herein includes chemical stability and solid state stability.

[0018] By "chemical stability", we include that it may be possible to store compounds of the invention in an isolated form, or in the form of a formulation in which it is provided in admixture with phanmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents or adjuvants (e.g. in an oral dosage form, such as a tablet, capsule. etc.), under normal storage conditions, with an insignificant degree of chemical degradation or decomposition.

[0019] By "solid state stability", we include that it may be possible to store compounds of the invention in an isolated solid form or in the form of a solid formulation in which it is provided in admixture with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents or adjuvants (e.g. in an oral dosage form, such as a tablet, capsule etc.), under normal storage conditions, with an insignificant degree of solid state transformation (e.g. crystaUisation, recrystallisation, solid state phase transition, hydration, dehydration, solvatisation or desolvatisation).

[0020] Examples of "normal storage conditions" include temperatures of between minus 80 and plus 50.degree. C. (preferably between 0 and 40.degree. C. and more preferably room temperatures, such as 15 to 30.degree. C.), pressures of between 0.1 and 2 bars (preferably at atmospheric pressure), relative humidities of between 5 and 95% (preferably 10 to 60%), and/or exposure to 460 lux of UV/visible light, for prolonged periods (le. greater than or equal to six months). Under such conditions, compounds of the invention may be found to be less than 15%, more preferably less than 10%, and especially less than 5%, chemically degraded/decomposed, or solid state transformed, as appropriate. The killed person will ap ate tt the above mentioned upper and lower liits for temperature, pressure and relative humidity represent extremes of normal storage conditions, and that certain combinations of these extr ns will not be experienced during normal storage (e.g. a temperature of 50.degree. C. and a pressure of 0.1 bar).

[0021] It may be possible to crystallise salts of conipomds of the present invention with or without the presence of a solvent system (e.g. crystallisation may be from a melt, under supercritical conditions, or achieved by sublimation). However, we prefer that crystallisation occurs from an appropriate solvent system.

[0022] According to a fiurher aspect of the invention, there is provided a process for the preparation of a crystalline compound of the invention which comprises crystallising a compound of the invention from an appropriate solvent system Suitable solvents include ethanol and toluene and mixtures thereof.

[0023] Crystalisation ahzes and crystallisation times depend upon the salt that is to be crystallised, the concentration of that salt in solution, and the solvent system which is used.

[0024] Crystallisation may also be initiated and/or effected by way of standard techniques, for example with or without seeding with crystals of the appropriate crystalline compound of the invention.

[0025] Different crystallie forms of the compounds of the invention may be readily characterised using X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) methods, for example as described hereinafter.

[0026] In order to ensure that a particular crystaline form is prepared in the absence of other crystalline forms, crystallisations are preferably carred out by seeding with nuclei and/or seed crystals of the desired crystalline form in substantially complete absence of nuclei and/or seed crystals of other crystalline forms. Seed crystals of appropriate compound may be prepared, for example, by way of slow evaporation of solvent from a portion of solution of appropriate salt.

[0027] Compounds of the invention may be isolated using techniques which are well known to those skilled in the art, for example decanting, filtering or centrifuging.

[0028] Compounds may be dried using standard techniques.

[0029] Further purification of compounds of the invention may be effected using techniques, which are well known to those skilled in the art. For example impurities may be removed by way of recrystallisation from an appropriate solvent system Suitable temperatures and times for the recrystallisation depend upon the concentration of the salt in solution, and upon the solvent system which is used.

[0030] When compounds of the invention are crystallised, or recrystallised, as described herein, the resultant salt may be in a form which has improved chemical and/or solid state stability, as mentioned hereinbefore.

[0031] Compounds of the invention have the advantage that they may be more efficacious, be less toxic, be longer acting, have a broader range of activity, be more potent, produce fewer side effects, be more easily absorbed, and/or have a better pharmacokinetic profile (e.g. higher oral bioavailability and/or lower clearance), tha, aundor have other usefuil pharmacological, physical, or chemical, properties over, compounds known in the prior art. Compounds of the invention may have the further advantage that they may be administered less frequently than compounds known in the prior art.

[0032] Compounds of the invention may also have the advantage that they are in a form which provides for improved ease of handling. Further, compounds of the invention have the advantage that they may be produced m forms which may have improved chemical and/or solid state stability (including e.g. due to lower hygroscopicity). Thus, such compounds of the invention may be stable when stored over prolonged periods.

[0033] Compounds of the invention may also have the advantage that they may be crystallised in good yields, in a high-purity, rapidly, conveniently, and at a low cost.

[0034] The compounds of the present invention have activity as medicaments, in particular the compounds are selective agonists of PPAR.alpha. that is, their EC.sub.50 for PPAR.alpha. is at least ten times lower than their respective EC.sub.50 for PPAR.gamma. wherein the EC.sub.50s are measured and calculated as descnbed in the assays later in this docment. The compounds are potent and selective.

EXAMPLES

Preparation of Acid Starting Material

(i) Methyl2-chloro-3-[4-(2-hydroxyethyl)penyl]prmpanoate

[0113] 2-(4Aminophenyl)ethanol (11 g, 81 mmol) and 32 ml conc HCl was dissolved in acetone and cooled to 0.degree. C. Sodium nitrite (5.6 g, 81 mmol) in 20 ml water was added dropwise. The temperature was kept under 0.degree. C. After one hour, methyl acrylate (70 g, 808 mmol) and CuI (1.6 g, 8 mmol) were added (<0.degree. C.). The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight.

[0114] The solvent was evaporated and water was added. The water phase was extracted three times with EtOAc, the organic phases were pooled and wasbed with water, dried (MgSO.sub.4) and evaporated under reduced pressure. The crude product was purified by flash chromatography using a 65:35 mixture of EtOAc and heptane as eluent. Putle purification by preparative BPLC (using a gradient of CH.sub.3CN/5%CH3CN-waterphase containing 0.1M NH.sub.4OAc as eluent) gave 9.7 g product (yield 49%) as an oil. [0115] .sup.1HNMR (400 MHz, CDC13) 2.84 (t, 3H), 3.15 (dd, 1H), 3.35 (dd, 1H), 3.75 (s, 3H), 3.84 (t, 3H), 4.43 (t, 1H), 7.17 (d, 4M (ii) Methyl 3-(4-12-(benzyloxn)phenoxylethyl]phenyl)-2-chloropropanoate

[0116] Triphenylphosphine (2.4 g, 9 mmol) was added to a solution of methyl 2-chloro-3-[4-(2-hydroxyethyl)phenyl]propanoate (2.1 lg, 8.5 mmol) and 4-(benzyloxy)phenol (1.7 g, 8 mmol) in 20 ml toluene under nitrogen atmosphere. The solution was warmed to 55.degree. C. and diisopropyl azodicarboxylate (1.8 g, 9nmo) was added. The reaction mixture was stirred at 55.degree. C. overnight.
