Description


The present invention relates to quinazoline derivatives, processes for their preparation, pharmaceutical compositions containing them as active ingredient, methods for the treatment of disease states associated with angiogenesis and/or increased vascular permeability, to their use as medicaments and to their use in the manufacture of medicaments for use in the production of antiangiogenic and/or vascular permeability reducing effects in warm-blooded animals such as humans.

Normal angiogenesis plays an important role in a variety of processes including embryonic development, wound healing and several components of female reproductive function. Undesirable or pathological angiogenesis has been associated with disease states including diabetic retinopathy, psoriasis, cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, atheroma, Kaposi's sarcoma and haemangioma (Fan et al, 1995, Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 16: 57-66; Folkman, 1995, Nature Medicine 1: 27-31). Alteration of vascular permeability is thought to play a role in both normal and pathological physiological processes (Cullinan-Bove et al, 1993, Endocrinology 133: 829-837; Senger et al, 1993, Cancer and Metastasis Reviews, 12: 303-324). Several polypeptides with in vitro endothelial cell growth promoting activity have been identified including, acidic and basic fibroblast growth factors (aFGF & bFGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). By virtue of the restricted expression of its receptors, the growth factor activity of VEGF, in contrast to that of the FGFs, is relatively specific towards endothelial cells. Recent evidence indicates that VEGF is an important stimulator of both normal and pathological angiogenesis (Jakeman et al, 1993, Endocrinology, 133: 848-859; Kolch et al, 1995, Breast Cancer Research and Treatment, 36:139-155) and vascular permeability (Connolly et al, 1989, J. Biol. Chem. 264: 20017-20024). Antagonism of VEGF action by sequestration of VEGF with antibody can result in inhibition of tumour growth (Kim et al, 1993, Nature 362: 841-844). Basic FGF (bFGF) is a potent stimulator of angiogenesis (e.g. Hayek et al, 1987, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun 147: 876-880) and raised levels of FGFs have been found in the serum (Fujimoto et al, 1991, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun 180: 386-392) and urine (Nguyen et al, 1993, J. Natl. Cancer. Inst. 85: 241-242) of patients with cancer.

Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are important in the transmission of biochemical signals across the plasma membrane of cells. These transmembrane molecules characteristically consist of an extracellular ligand-binding domain connected through a segment in the plasma membrane to an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. Binding of ligand to the receptor results in stimulation of the receptor-associated tyrosine kinase activity which leads to phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on both the receptor and other intracellular molecules. These changes in tyrosine phosphorylation initiate a signalling cascade leading to a variety of cellular responses. To date, at least nineteen distinct RTK subfamilies, defined by amino acid sequence homology, have been identified. One of these subfamilies is presently comprised by the fms-like tyrosine kinase receptor, Flt-1, the kinase insert domain-containing receptor, KDR (also referred to as Flk-1), and another fms-like tyrosine kinase receptor, Flt-4. Two of these related RTKs, Flt-1 and KDR, have been shown to bind VEGF with high affinity (De Vries et al, 1992, Science 255: 989-991; Terman et al, 1992, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1992, 187: 1579-1586). Binding of VEGF to these receptors expressed in heterologous cells has been associated with changes in the tyrosine phosphorylation status of cellular proteins and calcium fluxes.

The present invention is based on the discovery of compounds that surprisingly inhibit the effects of VEGF, a property of value in the treatment of disease states associated with angiogenesis and/or increased vascular permeability such as cancer, diabetes, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, Kaposi's sarcoma, haemangioma, lymphoedema, acute and chronic nephropathies, atheroma, arterial restenosis, autoimmune diseases, acute inflammation, excessive scar formation and adhesions, endometriosis, dysfunctional uterine bleeding and ocular diseases with retinal vessel proliferation including macular degeneration.

VEGF is a key stimulus for vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. This cytokine induces a vascular sprouting phenotype by inducing endothelial cell proliferation, protease expression and migration, and subsequent organisation of cells to form a capillary tube (Keck, P. J., Hauser, S. D., Krivi, G., Sanzo, K., Warren, T., Feder, J., and Connolly, D. T., Science (Washington D.C.), 246: 1309-1312, 1989; Lamoreaux, W. J., Fitzgerald, M. E., Reiner, A., Hasty, K. A., and Charles, S. T., Microvasc. Res., 55: 29-42, 1998; Pepper, M. S., Montesano, R., Mandroita, S. J., Orci, L. and Vassalli, J. D., Enzyme Protein, 49: 138-162, 1996). In addition, VEGF induces significant vascular permeability (Dvorak, H. F., Detmar, M., Claffey, K. P., Nagy, J. A., van de Water, L., and Senger, D. R., (Int. Arch. Allergy Immunol., 107: 233-235, 1995; Bates, D. O., Heald, R. I., Curry, F. E. and Williams, B. J. Physiol. (Lond.), 533: 263-272, 2001), promoting formation of a hyper-permeable, immature vascular network which is characteristic of pathological angiogenesis.

It has been shown that activation of KDR alone is sufficient to promote all of the major phenotypic responses to VEGF, including endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and survival, and the induction of vascular permeability (Meyer, M., Clauss, M., Lepple-Wienhues, A., Waltenberger, J., Augustin, H. G., Ziche, M., Lanz, C., Buttner, M., Rziha, H-J., and Dehio, C., EMBO J., 18: 363-374, 1999; Zeng, H., Sanyal, S. and Mukhopadhyay, D., J. Biol. Chem., 276: 32714-32719, 2001; Gille, H., Kowalski, J., Li, B., LeCouter, J., Moffat, B, Zioncheck, T. F., Pelletier, N. and Ferrara, N., J. Biol. Chem., 276: 3222-3230, 2001).

International patent application publication number WO 00/47212 describes VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Compounds of WO 00/47212 possess activity against VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) such that they may be used in an amount sufficient to inhibit VEGF RTK whilst demonstrating no significant activity against EGF RTK. Their VEGF RTK inhibitory activity is due both to activity against KDR and against Flt-1, but generally they are more potent against KDR. Generally they have extended plasma pharmacokinetics. Some VEGF RTK inhibitors have been found to act as potassium channel blockers and are positive in a hERG assay; such activity may give rise to ECG (electrocardiogram) changes in vivo. Compounds of WO 00/47212 have predominantly basic side chains.

Surprisingly we have now found compounds of the present invention to be very potent KDR inhibitors but to have less activity against Flt-1 than compounds of WO 00/47212, to have less extended plasma pharmacokinetics than compounds of WO 00/47212 and to be inactive or only weakly active in a hERG assay. Compounds of the present invention have predominantly neutral side chains. Compounds of the present invention have a beneficial toxicological profile compared to compounds of WO 00/47212.

Within the present invention it is to be understood that a compound of the formula I or a salt thereof may exhibit the phenomenon of tautomerism and that the formulae drawings within this specification can represent only one of the possible tautomeric forms. It is to be understood that the invention encompasses any tautomeric form which inhibits VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase activity and is not to be limited merely to any one tautomeric form utilised within the formulae drawings. The formulae drawings within this specification can represent only one of the possible tautomeric forms and it is to be understood that the specification encompasses all possible tautomeric forms of the compounds drawn not just those forms which it has been possible to show graphically herein.

It will be appreciated that compounds of the formula I or a salt thereof may possess an asymmetric carbon atom. Such an asymmetric carbon atom is also involved in the tautomerism described above, and it is to be understood that the present invention encompasses any chiral form (including both pure enantiomers, scalemic and racemic mixtures) as well as any tautomeric form which inhibits VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase activity, and is not to be limited merely to any one tautomeric form or chiral form utilised within the formulae drawings. It is to be understood that the invention encompasses all optical and diastereomers which inhibit VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase activity. It is further to be understood that in the names of chiral compounds (R,S) denotes any scalemic or racemic mixture while (R) and (S) denote the enantiomers. In the absence of (R,S), (R) or (S) in the name it is to be understood that the name refers to any scalemic or racemic mixture, wherein a scalemic mixture contains R and S enantiomers in any relative proportions and a racemic mixture contains R and S enantiomers in the ration 50:50.

It is also to be understood that certain compounds of the formula I and salts thereof can exist in solvated as well as unsolvated forms such as, for example, hydrated forms. It is to be understood that the invention encompasses all such solvated forms which inhibit VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase activity.

For the avoidance of any doubt, it is to be understood that when X.sup.1 is, for example, a group of formula --NR.sup.6C(O)--, it is the nitrogen atom bearing the R.sup.6 group which is attached to the quinazoline ring and the carbonyl (C(O)) group is attached to R.sup.5, whereas when X.sup.1 is, for example, a group of formula --C(O)NR.sup.7--, it is the carbonyl group which is attached to the quinazoline ring and the nitrogen atom bearing the R.sup.7 group is attached to R.sup.5. A similar convention applies to the other two atom X.sup.1 linking groups such as --NR.sup.9SO.sub.2-- and --SO.sub.2NR.sup.8--. When X.sup.1 is --NR.sup.16-- it is the nitrogen atom bearing the R.sup.10 group which is linked to the quinazoline ring and to R.sup.5. An analogous convention applies to other groups. It is further to be understood that when X.sup.1 represents --NR.sup.10-- and R.sup.10 is C.sub.1-3alkoxyC.sub.2-3alkyl it is the C.sub.2-3alkyl moiety which is linked to the nitrogen atom of X.sup.1 and an analogous convention applies to other groups.

For the avoidance of any doubt, it is to be understood that in a compound of the formula I when R.sup.5 is, for example, a group of formula C.sub.1-3alkylX.sup.9C.sub.1-3alkylR.sup.29, it is the terminal C.sub.1-3alkyl moiety which is linked to X.sup.1, similarly when R.sup.5 is, for example, a group of formula C.sub.2-5alkenylR.sup.28 it is the C.sub.2-5alkenyl moiety which is linked to X.sup.1 and an analogous convention applies to other groups. When R.sup.5 is a group 1-R.sup.29prop-1-en-3-yl it is the first carbon to which the group R.sup.29 is attached and it is the third carbon which is linked to X.sup.1 and an analogous convention applies to other groups.

For the avoidance of any doubt, it is to be understood that in a compound of the formula I when R.sup.5 is, for example, R.sup.28 and R.sup.28 is a pyrrolidinyl ring which bears a group --(--O--).sub.f(C.sub.1-4alkyl).sub.gringD, it is the --O-- or C.sub.1-4alkyl which is linked to the pyrrolidinyl ring, unless f and g are both 0 when it is ring D which is linked to the pyrrolidinyl ring and an analogous convention applies to other groups.

For the avoidance of any doubt, it is to be understood that when R.sup.29 carries a C.sub.1-4aminoalkyl substituent it is the C.sub.1-4alkyl moiety which is attached to R.sup.29 whereas when R.sup.29 carries a C.sub.1-4alkylamino substituent it is the amino moiety which is attached to R.sup.29 and an analogous convention applies to other groups.

For the avoidance of any doubt, it is to be understood that when R.sup.2 is --X.sup.1--C.sub.1-4alkyl-Q.sup.13-C(O)--C.sub.1-4alkyl-Q.sup.14 it is X.sup.1 that is linked to the quinazoline ring, Q.sup.13 is linked to the C.sub.1-4alkyl chain and to the carbonyl group, the carbonyl group is also linked to the terminal C.sub.1-4alkyl chain and Q.sup.14 is linked to the terminal C.sub.1-4alkyl chain.

A particular value of C.sub.1-6alkanoylC.sub.1-6alkyl is acetylmethyl.

The present invention relates to the compounds of formula I as hereinbefore defined as well as to the salts thereof. Salts for use in pharmaceutical compositions will be pharmaceutically acceptable salts, but other salts may be useful in the production of the compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the invention may, for example, include acid addition salts of the compounds of formula I as hereinbefore defined which are sufficiently basic to form such salts. Such acid addition salts include for example salts with inorganic or organic acids affording pharmaceutically acceptable anions such as with hydrogen halides (especially hydrochloric or hydrobromic acid of which hydrochloric acid is particularly preferred) or with sulphuric or phosphoric acid, or with trifluoroacetic, citric or maleic acid. In addition where the compounds of formula I are sufficiently acidic, pharmaceutically acceptable salts may be formed with an inorganic or organic base which affords a pharmaceutically acceptable cation. Such salts with inorganic or organic bases include for example an alkali metal salt, such as a sodium or potassium salt, an alkaline earth metal salt such as a calcium or magnesium salt, an ammonium salt or for example a salt with methylamine, dimethylamine, trimethylamine, piperidine, morpholine or tris-(2-hydroxyethyl)amine

A compound of the formula I, or salt thereof, and other compounds of the invention (as herein defined) may be prepared by any process known to be applicable to the preparation of chemically-related compounds. Such processes include, for example, those illustrated in International Patent Application Number WO 00/47212 and in European Patent Applications Publication Nos. 0520722, 0566226, 0602851 and 0635498. Such processes also include, for example, solid phase synthesis. Such processes, are provided as a further feature of the invention and are as described hereinafter. Necessary starting materials may be obtained by standard procedures of organic chemistry. The preparation of such starting materials is described within the accompanying non-limiting Examples. Alternatively necessary starting materials are obtainable by analogous procedures to those illustrated which are within the ordinary skill of an organic chemist.

Thus, the following processes (a) to (f) and (i) to (vi) constitute further features of the present invention.

Synthesis of Compounds of Formula I

(a) Compounds of the formula I and salts thereof may be prepared by the reaction of a compound of the formula III:

##STR00021## (wherein R.sup.2 and m are as defined hereinbefore and L.sup.1 is a displaceable moiety), with a compound of the formula IV:

##STR00022## (wherein ring C, R.sup.1, Z and n are as defined hereinbefore) to obtain compounds of the formula I and salts thereof. A convenient displaceable moiety L.sup.1 is, for example, a halogeno, alkoxy (preferably C.sub.1-4alkoxy), aryloxy, alkylsulphanyl, arylsulphanyl, alkoxyalkylsulphanyl or sulphonyloxy group, for example a chloro, bromo, methoxy, phenoxy, methylsulphanyl, 2-methoxyethylsulphanyl, methanesulphonyloxy or toluene-4-sulphonyloxy group.

The reaction is advantageously effected in the presence of a base. Such a base is, for example, an organic amine base such as, for example, pyridine, 2,6-lutidine, collidine, 4-dimethylaminopyridine, triethylamine, morpholine, N-methylmorpholine or diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene, tetramethylguanidine or for example, an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal carbonate or hydroxide, for example sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, calcium carbonate, cesium carbonate, sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide. Alternatively such a base is, for example, an alkali metal hydride, for example sodium hydride, or an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal amide, for example sodium amide, sodium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide, potassium amide or potassium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide. The reaction is preferably effected in the presence of an inert solvent or diluent, for example an ether such as tetrahydrofuran or 1,4-dioxan, an aromatic hydrocarbon solvent such as toluene, or a dipolar aprotic solvent such as N,N-dimethylformamide, N,N-dimethylacetamide, N-methylpyrrolidin-2-one or dimethyl sulphoxide. The reaction is conveniently effected at a temperature in the range, for example, 10 to 150.degree. C., preferably in the range 20 to 90.degree. C.

Where R.sup.1 or R.sup.2 contains a heterocyclic ring with a substituent it is possible to add the substituent after process (a) above using standard procedures of organic chemistry. Thus for example a compound of formula III as defined hereinbefore but wherein R.sup.2 contains an unsubstituted heterocyclic ring may be reacted with a compound of formula IV as defined hereinbefore to give an intermediate compound in which R.sup.2 contains an unsubstituted heterocyclic ring. The intermediate compound can then be substituted on the heterocyclic ring in R.sup.2 using standard organic chemistry techniques to give a final compound of formula I.

When it is desired to obtain the acid salt, the free base may be treated with an acid such as a hydrogen halide, for example hydrogen chloride, sulphuric acid, a sulphonic acid, for example methane sulphonic acid, or a carboxylic acid, for example acetic or citric acid, using a conventional procedure.

(b) Production of those compounds of formula I and salts thereof wherein at least one R.sup.2 is R.sup.5X.sup.1 or Q.sup.1X.sup.1 wherein R.sup.5, Q.sup.1 are as defined hereinbefore, and X.sup.1 is --O--, --S--, --OC(O)-- or --NR.sup.10-- (wherein R.sup.10 independently represents hydrogen, C.sub.1-3alkyl or C.sub.1-3alkoxyC.sub.2-3alkyl) can be achieved by the reaction, conveniently in the presence of a base (as defined hereinbefore in process (a)) of a compound of the formula V:

The reaction is preferably effected in the presence of a base (as defined hereinbefore in process (a)) and advantageously in the presence of an inert solvent or diluent (as defined hereinbefore in process (a)), advantageously at a temperature in the range, for example 10 to 150.degree.

The compounds of formula III and salts thereof wherein at least one R.sup.2 is R.sup.5X.sup.1 and wherein X.sup.1 is a direct bond may be prepared for example as described above from a compound of the formula XI, wherein the R.sup.5 group is already present in the intermediate compounds (for example in a compound of the formula XV) used to prepare the compound of formula XI.

The compounds of formula III and salts thereof wherein at least one R.sup.2 is R.sup.5X.sup.1 and wherein X.sup.1 is --NR.sup.6C(O)-- or --NR.sup.9SO.sub.2-- may be prepared for example from a compound of the formula XIII in which HX.sup.1-- is an --NHR.sup.6-- or --NHR.sup.9-- group (prepared for example from an amino group (later functionalised if necessary) by reduction of a nitro group) which is reacted with an acid chloride or sulfonyl chloride compound of the formula R.sup.5COCl or R.sup.5SO.sub.2Cl.

The compounds of formula III and salts thereof wherein at least one R.sup.2 is R.sup.5X.sup.1 or Q.sup.1X.sup.1, wherein R.sup.5 and Q.sup.1 are as defined hereinbefore, and wherein X.sup.1 is --O--, --S--, --SO.sub.2--, --OC(O)--, --C(O)NR.sup.7--, --SO.sub.2NR.sup.8-- or --NR.sup.10-- (wherein R.sup.7, R.sup.8 and R.sup.10 each independently represents hydrogen, C.sub.1-3alkyl or C.sub.1-3alkoxyC.sub.2-3alkyl), may also be prepared for example by reacting a compound of the formula XVIII:

##STR00033## (wherein R.sup.2 and s are as hereinbefore defined, X.sup.1 is as hereinbefore defined in this section and L.sup.2 represents a displaceable protecting moiety) with one of the compounds of formulae VIa-b as hereinbefore defined, whereby to obtain a compound of formula III in which L.sup.1 is represented by L.sup.2.

A compound of formula XVIII is conveniently used in which L.sup.2 represents a phenoxy group which may if desired carry up to 5 substituents, preferably up to 2 substituents, selected from halogeno, nitro and cyano. The reaction may be conveniently effected under conditions as described for process (b) hereinbefore.

The compounds of formula XVIII and salts thereof may for example be prepared by deprotecting a compound of the formula XIX:

##STR00034## (wherein R.sup.2, s and L.sup.2 are as hereinbefore defined, P.sup.1 is a protecting group and X.sup.1 is as hereinbefore defined in the section describing compounds of the formula XVIII). The choice of protecting group P.sup.1 is within the standard knowledge of an organic chemist, for example those included in standard texts such as "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis" T. W. Greene and R. G. M. Wuts, 2nd Ed. Wiley 1991, including N-sulphonyl derivatives (for example, p-toluenesulphonyl), carbamates (for example, t-butyl carbonyl), N-alkyl derivatives (for example, 2-chloroethyl, benzyl) and amino acetal derivatives (for example benzyloxymethyl). The removal of such a protecting group may be effected by any of the procedures known for such a transformation, including those reaction conditions indicated in standard texts such as that indicated hereinbefore, or by a related procedure. Deprotection may be effected by techniques well known in the literature, for example where P.sup.1 represents a benzyl group deprotection may be effected by hydrogenolysis or by treatment with trifluoroacetic acid.

One compound of formula III may if desired be converted into another compound of formula III in which the moiety L.sup.1 is different. Thus for example a compound of formula III in which L.sup.1 is other than halogeno, for example optionally substituted phenoxy, may be converted to a compound of formula III in which L.sup.1 is halogeno by hydrolysis of a compound of formula III (in which L.sup.1 is other than halogeno) to yield a compound of formula XI as hereinbefore defined, followed by introduction of halide to the compound of formula XI, thus obtained as hereinbefore defined, to yield a compound of formula III in which L.sup.1 represents halogen.

The reaction may be effected for example by a process as described in (b) above. (vi) Intermediate compounds wherein X.sup.1 is --SO-- or --SO.sub.2-- may be prepared by oxidation from the corresponding compound in which X.sup.1 is --S-- or --SO-- (when X.sup.1 is --SO.sub.2-- is required in the final product). Conventional oxidation conditions and reagents for such reactions are well known to the skilled chemist.

When a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of a compound of the formula I is required, it may be obtained, for example, by reaction of said compound with, for example, an acid using a conventional procedure, the acid having a pharmaceutically acceptable anion.

Many of the intermediates defined herein are novel and these are provided as a further feature of the invention. The preparation of these compounds is as described herein and/or is by methods well known to persons skilled in the art of organic chemistry.

The identification of compounds which inhibit angiogenesis and/or increased vascular permeability, which potently inhibit the tyrosine kinase activity associated with the VEGF receptor KDR and are selective for KDR over Flt-1, which have less extended plasma pharmacokinetics and which are inactive or only weakly active in the hERG assay, is desirable and is the subject of the present invention.

These properties may be assessed, for example, using one or more of the procedures set out below:

(a) In Vitro Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibition Test

This assay determines the ability of a test compound to inhibit tyrosine kinase activity. DNA encoding VEGF, FGF or EGF receptor cytoplasmic domains may be obtained by total gene synthesis (Edwards M, International Biotechnology Lab 5(3), 19-25, 1987) or by cloning. These may then be expressed in a suitable expression system to obtain polypeptide with tyrosine kinase activity. For example VEGF, FGF and EGF receptor cytoplasmic domains, which were obtained by expression of recombinant protein in insect cells, were found to display intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. In the case of the VEGF receptor Flt-1 (Genbank accession number X51602), a 1.7 kb DNA fragment encoding most of the cytoplasmic domain, commencing with methionine 783 and including the termination codon, described by Shibuya et al (Oncogene, 1990, 5: 519-524), was isolated from cDNA and cloned into a baculovirus transplacement vector (for example pAcYM1 (see The Baculovirus Expression System: A Laboratory Guide, L. A. King and R. D. Possee, Chapman and Hall, 1992) or pAc360 or pBlueBacHis (available from Invitrogen Corporation)). This recombinant construct was co-transfected into insect cells (for example Spodoptera frugiperda 21(5f21)) with viral DNA (eg Pharmingen BaculoGold) to prepare recombinant baculovirus. (Details of the methods for the assembly of recombinant DNA molecules and the preparation and use of recombinant baculovirus can be found in standard texts for example Sambrook et al, 1989, Molecular cloning--A Laboratory Manual, 2nd edition, Cold Spring Harbour Laboratory Press and O'Reilly et al, 1992, Baculovirus Expression Vectors--A Laboratory Manual, W. H. Freeman and Co, New York). For other tyrosine kinases for use in assays, cytoplasmic fragments starting from methionine 806 (KDR, Genbank accession number L04947), methionine 668 (EGF receptor, Genbank accession number X00588) and methionine 399 (FGF R1 receptor, Genbank accession number X51803) may be cloned and expressed in a similar manner.

For expression of cFlt-1 tyrosine kinase activity, Sf21 cells were infected with plaque-pure cFlt-1 recombinant virus at a multiplicity of infection of 3 and harvested 48 hours later. Harvested cells were washed with ice cold phosphate buffered saline solution (PBS) (10 mM sodium phosphate pH7.4, 138 mM sodium chloride, 2.7 mM potassium chloride) then resuspended in ice cold HNTG/PMSF (20 mM Hepes pH7.5, 150 mM sodium chloride, 10% v/v glycerol, 1% v/v Triton X100, 1.5 mM magnesium chloride, 1 mM ethylene glycol-bis(.beta.aminoethyl ether) N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA), 1 mM PMSF (phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride); the PMSF is added just before use from a freshly-prepared 100 mM solution in methanol) using 1 ml HNTG/PMSF per 10 million cells. The suspension was centrifuged for 10 minutes at 13,000 rpm at 4.degree. C., the supernatant (enzyme stock) was removed and stored in aliquots at -70.degree. C. Each new batch of stock enzyme was titrated in the assay by dilution with enzyme diluent (100 mM Hepes pH 7.4, 0.2 mM sodium orthovanadate, 0.1% v/v Triton X100, 0.2 mM dithiothreitol). For a typical batch, stock enzyme is diluted 1 in 2000 with enzyme diluent and 50 .mu.l of dilute enzyme is used for each assay well.

A stock of substrate solution was prepared from a random copolymer containing tyrosine, for example Poly (Glu, Ala, Tyr) 6:3:1 (Sigma P3899), stored as 1 mg/ml stock in PBS at -20.degree. C. and diluted 1 in 500 with PBS for plate coating.

On the day before the assay 100 .mu.l of diluted substrate solution was dispensed into all wells of assay plates (Nunc maxisorp 96-well immunoplates) which were sealed and left overnight at 4.degree. C.

On the day of the assay the substrate solution was discarded and the assay plate wells were washed once with PBST (PBS containing 0.05% v/v Tween 20) and once with 50 mM Hepes pH7.4.

Test compounds were diluted with 10% dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) and 25 .mu.l of diluted compound was transferred to wells in the washed assay plates. "Total" control wells contained 10% DMSO instead of compound. Twenty five microliters of 40 mM manganese(II) chloride containing 8 .mu.M adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP) was added to all test wells except "blank" control wells which contained manganese(II) chloride without ATP. To start the reactions 50 .mu.l of freshly diluted enzyme was added to each well and the plates were incubated at ambient temperature for 20 minutes. The liquid was then discarded and the wells were washed twice with PBST. One hundred microliters of mouse IgG anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Upstate Biotechnology Inc. product 05-321), diluted 1 in 6000 with PBST containing 0.5% w/v bovine serum albumin (BSA), was added to each well and the plates were incubated for 1 hour at ambient temperature before discarding the liquid and washing the wells twice with PBST. One hundred microliters of horse radish peroxidase (HRP)-linked sheep anti-mouse Ig antibody (Amersham product NXA 931), diluted 1 in 500 with PBST containing 0.5% w/v BSA, was added and the plates were incubated for 1 hour at ambient temperature before discarding the liquid and washing the wells twice with PBST. One hundred microliters of 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) solution, freshly prepared using one 50 mg ABTS tablet (Boehringer 1204 521) in 50 ml freshly prepared 50 mM phosphate-citrate buffer pH5.0+0.03% sodium perborate (made with 1 phosphate citrate buffer with sodium perborate (PCSB) capsule (Sigma P4922) per 100 ml distilled water), was added to each well. Plates were then incubated for 20-60 minutes at ambient temperature until the optical density value of the "total" control wells, measured at 405 nm using a plate reading spectrophotometer, was approximately 1.0. "Blank" (no ATP) and "total" (no compound) control values were used to determine the dilution range of test compound which gave 50% inhibition of enzyme activity.

(b) In Vitro HUVEC Proliferation Assay

This assay determines the ability of a test compound to inhibit the growth factor-stimulated proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC).

HUVEC cells were isolated in MCDB 131 (Gibco BRL)+7.5% v/v foetal calf serum (FCS) and were plated out (at passage 2 to 8), in MCDB 131+2% v/v FCS+3 .mu.g/ml heparin+1 .mu.g/ml hydrocortisone, at a concentration of 1000 cells/well in 96 well plates. After a minimum of 4 hours they were dosed with the appropriate growth factor (i.e. VEGF 3 ng/ml, EGF 3 ng/ml or b-FGF 0.3 ng/ml) and compound. The cultures were then incubated for 4 days at 37.degree. C. with 7.5% CO.sub.2. On day 4 the cultures were pulsed with 1 .mu.Ci/well of tritiated-thymidine (Amersham product TRA 61) and incubated for 4 hours. The cells were harvested using a 96-well plate harvester (Tomtek) and then assayed for incorporation of tritium with a Beta plate counter. Incorporation of radioactivity into cells, expressed as cpm, was used to measure inhibition of growth factor-stimulated cell proliferation by compounds.

(c) In Vivo Solid Tumour Disease Model

This test measures the capacity of compounds to inhibit solid tumour growth.

CaLu-6 tumour xenografts were established in the flank of female athymic Swiss nu/nu mice, by subcutaneous injection of 1.times.10.sup.6 CaLu-6 cells/mouse in 100 .mu.l of a 50% (v/v) solution of Matrigel in serum free culture medium. Ten days after cellular implant, mice were allocated to groups of 8-10, so as to achieve comparable group mean volumes. Tumours were measured using vernier calipers and volumes were calculated as: (l.times.w).times. (l.times.w).times.(.pi./6), where l is the longest diameter and w the diameter perpendicular to the longest. Test compounds were administered orally once daily for a minimum of 21 days, and control animals received compound diluent. Tumours were measured twice weekly. The level of growth inhibition was calculated by comparison of the mean tumour volume of the control group versus the treatment group using a Student T test and/or a Mann-Whitney Rank Sum Test. The inhibitory effect of compound treatment was considered significant when p<0.05.

d) hERG-encoded Potassium Channel Inhibition Test

This assay determines the ability of a test compound to inhibit the tail current flowing through the human ether-a-go-go-related-gene (hERG)-encoded potassium channel.

Human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells expressing the hERG-encoded channel were grown in Minimum Essential Medium Eagle (EMEM; Sigma-Aldrich catalogue number M2279), supplemented with 10% Foetal Calf Serum (Labtech International; product number 4-101-500), 10% M1 serum-free supplement (Egg Technologies; product number 70916) and 0.4 mg/ml Geneticin G418 (Sigma-Aldrich; catalogue number G7034). One or two days before each experiment, the cells were detached from the tissue culture flasks with Accutase (TCS Biologicals) using standard tissue culture methods. They were then put onto glass coverslips resting in wells of a 12 well plate and covered with 2 ml of the growing media.

For each cell recorded, a glass coverslip containing the cells was placed at the bottom of a Perspex chamber containing bath solution (see below) at ambient temperature (-20.degree. C.). This chamber was fixed to the stage of an inverted, phase-contrast microscope Immediately after placing the coverslip in the chamber, bath solution was perfused into the chamber from a gravity-fed reservoir for 2 minutes at a rate of .about.2 ml/min. After this time, perfusion was stopped.

A patch pipette made from borosilicate glass tubing (GC120F, Harvard Apparatus) using a P-97 micropipette puller (Sutter Instrument Co.) was filled with pipette solution (see hereinafter). The pipette was connected to the headstage of the patch clamp amplifier (Axopatch 200B, Axon Instruments) via a silver/silver chloride wire. The headstage ground was connected to the earth electrode. This consisted of a silver/silver chloride wire embedded in 3% agar made up with 0.85% sodium chloride.

The cell was recorded in the whole cell configuration of the patch clamp technique. Following "break-in", which was done at a holding potential of -80 mV (set by the amplifier), and appropriate adjustment of series resistance and capacitance controls, electrophysiology software (Clampex, Axon Instruments) was used to set a holding potential (-80 mV) and to deliver a voltage protocol. This protocol was applied every 15 seconds and consisted of a 1 s step to +40 mV followed by a 1 s step to -50 mV. The current response to each imposed voltage protocol was low pass filtered by the amplifier at 1 kHz. The filtered signal was then acquired, on line, by digitising this analogue signal from the amplifier with an analogue to digital converter. The digitised signal was then captured on a computer running Clampex software (Axon Instruments). During the holding potential and the step to +40 mV the current was sampled at 1 kHz. The sampling rate was then set to 5 kHz for the remainder of the voltage protocol.

The compositions, pH and osmolarity of the bath and pipette solution are tabulated below.

TABLE-US-00001 Salt Pipette (mM) Bath (mM) NaCl -- 137 KCl 130 4 MgCl.sub.2 1 1 CaCl.sub.2 -- 1.8 HEPES 10 10 glucose -- 10 Na.sub.2ATP 5 -- EGTA 5 -- Parameter Pipette Bath pH 7.18-7.22 7.40 pH adjustment with 1M KOH 1M NaOH Osmolarity (mOsm) 275-285 285-295

The amplitude of the hERG-encoded potassium channel tail current following the step from +40 mV to -50 mV was recorded on-line by Clampex software (Axon Instruments). Following stabilisation of the tail current amplitude, bath solution containing the vehicle for the test substance was applied to the cell. Providing the vehicle application had no significant effect on tail current amplitude, a cumulative concentration effect curve to the compound was then constructed.

The effect of each concentration of test compound was quantified by expressing the tail current amplitude in the presence of a given concentration of test compound as a percentage of that in the presence of vehicle.

Test compound potency (IC.sub.50) was determined by fitting the percentage inhibition values making up the concentration-effect to a four parameter Hill equation using a standard data-fitting package. If the level of inhibition seen at the highest test concentration did not exceed 50%, no potency value was produced and a percentage inhibition value at that concentration was quoted.

Although the pharmacological properties of the compounds of formula I vary with structural change, in general, activity possessed by compounds of the formula I, may be demonstrated at the following concentrations or doses in one or more of the above tests (a), (b) and (c)

Test (a):--IC.sub.50 in the range, for example, <5 .mu.M;

Test (b):--IC.sub.50 in the range, for example, 0.001-5 .mu.M;

Test (c):--activity in the range, for example, 0.1-100 mg/kg;

Example 11 of the present application has an IC.sub.50 value in the enzyme assay (a) of 0.104 .mu.M against KDR.

Example 11 of the present application has an IC.sub.50 of 10.1 .mu.M in the hERG assay (d).

Plasma pharmacokinetics may be assessed by measuring plasma half-life in vivo. The longer the plasma half-life in vivo the more extended are the plasma pharmacokinetics.

Compounds of the present invention have less extended plasma pharmacokinetics than compounds of WO 00/47212. Compounds of the present invention have shorter half-lives in vivo than compounds of WO 00/47212.

Plasma half-life in vivo may be determined by standard methods which are well-known in the art of plasma pharmacokinetics. Any species may be used and the plasma half-life determined by standard methodology, for example plasma half-life may be measured in rat, dog, monkey or human.

According to a further aspect of the invention there is provided a pharmaceutical composition which comprises a compound of the formula I as defined hereinbefore or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier.

The composition may be in a form suitable for oral administration, for example as a tablet or capsule, for parenteral injection (including intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravascular or infusion) for example as a sterile solution, suspension or emulsion, for topical administration for example as an ointment or cream or for rectal administration for example as a suppository. In general the above compositions may be prepared in a conventional manner using conventional excipients.

The compositions of the present invention are advantageously presented in unit dosage form. The compound will normally be administered to a warm-blooded animal at a unit dose within the range 5-5000 mg per square meter body area of the animal, i.e. approximately 0.1-100 mg/kg. A unit dose in the range, for example, 1-100 mg/kg, preferably 1-50 mg/kg is envisaged and this normally provides a therapeutically-effective dose. A unit dose form such as a tablet or capsule will usually contain, for example 1-250 mg of active ingredient.

Chem. 1975, 10, 187), and potassium carbonate (2.6 g), were added and the mixture heated at 90.degree. C. for 3 hours. The solid was removed by filtration and the filtrate was concentrated to dryness under vacuum. The residue was purified by column chromatography on silica using increasingly polar solvent mixtures, starting with ethyl acetate/petroleum ether (1/1) and ending with (75/25). Evaporation of the solvents gave, 7-{[1-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-piperidin-4-yl]oxy}-6-methoxy-4-[(2-methyl-1H- -indol-6-yl)oxy]quinazoline (5.4 g) as a yellow foam.

7-{[1-(tert-Butoxycarbonyl)-piperidin-4-yl]oxy}-6-methoxy-4-[(2-methyl-1H- -indol-6-yl)oxy]quinazoline (1 g) was dissolved in dichloromethane (5 ml) and cooled in an ice bath. TFA (2.5 ml) was added and the reaction mixture stirred at this temperature for 35 minutes. The volatiles were removed by filtration and the residue taken up into ice cold water. The pH was adjusted to 12 with sodium hydroxide 2N and extracted twice with dichloromethane. The combined extracts were washed in turn with water and brine and dried over magnesium sulphate and the solvent evaporated under vacuum to give 6-methoxy-4-[(2-methyl-1H-indol-6-yl)oxy]-7-[(piperidin-4-yl)oxy]quinazol- ine (0.765 g) as a solid foam.
