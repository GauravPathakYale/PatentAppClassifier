Said ASCII copy, created on Jan. 25, 2017, is named 2000357-US-NP_SL.txt and is 10,785 bytes in size\\n\\nThis specification relates to arylamide compounds having pharmaceutical activity, to processes for preparing such compounds, to pharmaceutical compositions comprising such compounds and to the use of such compounds as active therapeutic agents.\\n\\nRetinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptors (RORs) are a family of transcription factors which belong to the nuclear receptor superfamily. The family is comprised of three genes, RORA, RORB, and RORC, all of which express more than one isoform of the protein (Jetten, A M; Kurebayashi, S; Ueda, E. (2006) Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 69:205-47). RORC (also known as ROR.gamma. or NR1F3) is translated into two major protein isoforms which share most of the amino acid sequence, including the ligand binding domain, but differ 21 amino acids in length in the N-terminal end. The two isoforms are differentially expressed. The longer form (ROR.gamma.) is found in many tissues such as liver, kidney, muscle and some cells of hematopoetic origin whereas the shorter form (ROR.gamma.t) is expressed in the thymus and cells of the immune system (He, Y W; Deftos, M L; Ojala, E W; Bevan, M J (1998) Immunity 9(6):797-806). ROR.gamma.t has been shown to be required for differentiation and function of Th17 cells and coordinates the expression of IL17 in many immune cells (Ivanov, II; McKenzie, BS; Zhou, L; Littman, D R et al. (2006) Cell 126:1121-1133). Th17 cells are a subset of T helper cells that produce IL17, IL22, and other cytokines. They attain their Th17 phenotype through local exposure to a combination of cytokines such as TGF.beta., IL1.beta. and IL23. The mediators and transcription factors that are required for their differentiation, polarization and effector function are referred to as the Th17 axis, and the Th17 axis includes other cell types which produce the same cytokines (and corresponding receptors), such as innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) and .gamma..delta. T cells.\\n\\nThe Th17 axis of biological processes has been implicated in the pathology of many human diseases with an immune component or autoimmune pathology, such as psoriasis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, ulcerative cholitis, Crohn\\'s disease, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, graft versus host disease, systemic lupus erythematosis, lupus nephtritis, insulin dependent diabetes type I, and also in cancer (Wilke C M, Bishop K, Fox D, Zou W (2011) Trends Immunol. 32(12):603-11; Bartlett, H S; Million, R P (2015) Nat. Rev. Drug Discovery 14:11-12). Many of these diseases share genetic associations to genes contained in the Th17 axis (Gaffen S L, Jain R, Garg A V, Cua D J (2014) Nat. Rev. Immunol. 14(9):585-600).\\n\\nROR.gamma.t is central to the Th17 axis since it is required for the function of Th17 cells and governs cytokine production and related biological processes in many other cell types. Due to the central role of ROR.gamma.t it is desirable to regulate ROR.gamma.t activity as a means of treatment of diseases where the Th17 axis is perturbed. Accordingly there is a need for new therapeutic agents which modulate ROR.gamma.t.\\n\\nBriefly, this specification describes, in part, a compound of formula (I):\\n\\n##STR00002##\\n\\nwherein:\\n\\nR.sup.1 is H or (CO)R.sup.4;\\n\\nR.sup.2 is C.sub.1-6 alkyl, cyclopropyl, CH.sub.2-cyclopropyl, or NR.sup.5R.sup.6, wherein said C.sub.1-6 alkyl is optionally substituted with OH or C.sub.1-6 alkoxy and said CH.sub.2-cyclopropyl is optionally substituted with halo, OH, CN or C.sub.1-6 alkoxy;\\n\\nR.sup.3 is H, C.sub.1-6 alkyl, C.sub.1-6 alkoxy, halo or CN.\\n\\nR.sup.4 is: H; C.sub.1-6 alkyl optionally substituted with (R.sup.7).sub.a; C.sub.3-7 cycloalkyl optionally substituted with halo, C.sub.1-6 alkyl, OH, CN, C.sub.1-6 alkoxy, or C.sub.1-3 alkyl-OR.sup.8; heterocycloalkyl optionally substituted with C.sub.1-6 alkyl or OH; C.sub.1-6 alkoxy; or NHR.sup.13;\\n\\na is 1, 2 or 3;\\n\\nR.sup.6 is H, C.sub.1-6 alkyl or C.sub.3-7 cycloalkyl;\\n\\nR.sup.7 is independently selected from the group consisting of halo, OH, CN, C.sub.1-6 alkoxy, NR.sup.9R.sup.10, C.sub.3-7 cycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl and aryl, wherein said C.sub.3-7 cycloalkyl, heterocycloalkyl or aryl groups are further optionally substituted with 1, 2 or 3 groups independently selected from the group consisting of C.sub.1-6 alkyl, CN, OH, C.sub.1-6 alkoxy and NR.sup.11R.sup.12;\\n\\nR.sup.13 is H, C.sub.1-6 alkyl or C.sub.3-7 cycloalkyl;\\n\\nR.sup.5, R.sup.8, R.sup.9, R.sup.10, R.sup.11 and R.sup.12 are each independently H or C.sub.1-6 alkyl;\\n\\nor a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.\\n\\nThis specification also describes, in part, pharmaceutical compositions which comprise a compound of the formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and at least one pharmaceutically acceptable excipient.\\n\\nThis specification also describes, in part, a compound of formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, for use in therapy.\\n\\nThis specification also describes, in part, a compound of formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, for the treatment or prevention of an ROR.gamma. and/or ROR.gamma.t mediated disease state.\\n\\nThis specification also describes, in part, the use of a compound of formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment or prevention of an ROR.gamma. and/or ROR.gamma.t mediated disease state.\\n\\nThis specification also describes, in part, a method of treating or of preventing an ROR.gamma. and/or ROR.gamma.t mediated disease state in a mammal suffering from, or at risk of, said disease, which comprises administering to a mammal in need of such treatment a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.\\n\\nFurther aspects of the specification will be apparent to one skilled in the art from reading this specification.\\n\\nThe compounds of the specification may exist in salt-form or in non-salt form (ie. as a free base), and the present specification covers both salt forms and non-salt forms. Compounds described in this specification may form acid addition salts or base addition salts. In general, an acid addition salt can be prepared using various inorganic or organic acids. Such salts can typically be formed by, for example, mixing the compound with an acid (e.g. a stoichiometric amount of an acid) using various methods known in the art. This mixing may occur in water, an organic solvent (e.g. ether, ethyl acetate, ethanol, methanol, isopropanol, or acetonitrile), or an aqueous/organic mixture. In another aspect of the specification acid addition salts are, for example, trifluoroacetate, formate, acetate or hydrochloric. In general, a base addition salt can be prepared using various inorganic or organic bases, for example an alkali or alkaline earth metal salt such as a sodium, calcium or magnesium salt, or other metal salts, such as potassium or zinc, or an ammonium salt, or a salt with an organic base such as methylamine, dimethylamine, trimethylamine, piperidine or morpholine. The skilled person will be aware of the general principles and techniques of preparing pharmaceutical salts, such as those described in, for example, Berge et al., J. Pharm. Sci., 66, 1-19 (1977).\\n\\nCompounds and salts described in this specification include one or more chiral (i.e. asymmetric) centres. To the extent a structure or chemical name in this specification does not indicate the chirality, the structure or name is intended to encompass any single stereoisomer (i.e. any single chiral isomer) corresponding to that structure or name, as well as any mixture of stereoisomers (e.g. a racemate). In some embodiments, a single stereoisomer is obtained by isolating it from a mixture of isomers (e.g. a racemate) using, for example, chiral chromatographic separation. In other embodiments, a single stereoisomer is obtained through direct synthesis from, for example, a chiral starting material.\\n\\nA particular enantiomer of a compound described herein may be more active than other enantiomers of the same compound.\\n\\nAccording to one embodiment there is provided a compound of formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, which is a single enantiomer being in an enantiomeric excess (% ee) of .gtoreq.95, .gtoreq.98% or .gtoreq.99%. Conveniently, the single enantiomer is present in an enantiomeric excess (% ee) of .gtoreq.99%.\\n\\nAccording to another embodiment there is provided a pharmaceutical composition, which comprises a compound of formula (I), which is a single enantiomer being in an enantiomeric excess (% ee) of .gtoreq.95, .gtoreq.98% or .gtoreq.99% or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in association with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. Conveniently, the single enantiomer is present in an enantiomeric excess (% ee) of .gtoreq.99%.\\n\\nWhen in solid crystalline form a compound of formula (I) can be in the form of a co-crystal with another chemical entity and the specification encompasses all such co-crystals.\\n\\nThe compounds of the specification may exist as a solvate (such as a hydrate) as well as unsolvated forms, and the present specification covers all such solvates.\\n\\nCompounds and salts described in this specification may exist in various tautomeric forms and the specification encompasses all such tautomeric forms. \"Tautomers\" are structural isomers that exist in equilibrium resulting from the migration of a hydrogen atom.\\n\\nCompounds and salts described in this specification may be isotopically-labeled (or \"radio-labeled\"). In that instance, one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number typically found in nature. The specification encompasses isotopically-labelled forms of compounds disclosed herein. Examples of isotopes that may be incorporated include .sup.2H (also written as \"D\" for deuterium), .sup.3H (also written as \"T\" for tritium), .sup.11C, .sup.13C, .sup.14C, .sup.13N, .sup.15N, .sup.15O, .sup.17O, .sup.18O and .sup.36Cl. The isotope that is used will depend on the specific application of that radio-labeled derivative. For example, for in vitro receptor labeling and competition assays, .sup.3H or .sup.14C are often useful. For radio-imaging applications, .sup.11C is often useful. In some embodiments, the radionuclide is .sup.3H. In some embodiments, the radionuclide is .sup.14C. In some embodiments, the radionuclide is .sup.11C.\\n\\nUnless otherwise stated, halo is selected from chloro (Cl), fluoro (F), bromo (Br) and iodo (I), such as fluoro.\\n\\nCycloalkyl is a non-aromatic carbocyclic ring. The carbocyclic ring may be saturated or unsaturated, and may be bridged or unbridged. C.sub.3-7 cycloalkyl is any such carbocyclic ring containing 3 to 7 carbon atoms. An example of C.sub.3-7 cycloalkyl is an unsaturated non-aromatic carbocyclic ring containing 3 to 7 carbon atoms. Examples of suitable cycloalkyl groups are cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl and cycloheptyl, such as cyclopropyl and cyclobutyl.\\n\\nHeterocycloalkyl is a 3 to 9 membered non-aromatic, mono- or bi-cyclic ring comprising one or two heteroatoms independently selected from nitrogen, oxygen or sulphur; or an N-oxide thereof, or an S-oxide or S-dioxide thereof. The ring may be saturated or unsaturated, and may be bridged or unbridged. An example of heterocycloalkyl is an unsaturated 4 to 6 membered non-aromatic, mono-cyclic ring comprising one heteroatom independently selected from nitrogen or oxygen; or an N-oxide thereof. Examples of suitable heterocycloalkyl groups include oxiranyl, aziridinyl, azetidinyl, oxetanyl, tetrahydrofuranyl, pyrrolidinyl, tetrahydropyranyl, piperidinyl, morpholinyl, thiomorpholinyl, and piperazinyl, such as azetidinyl, oxetanyl, pyrrolidinyl or tetrahydrofuranyl, for example oxetanyl or tetrahydrofuranyl. For the avoidance of doubt, substituents on the heterocycloalkyl ring may be linked via either a carbon atom or a heteroatom.\\n\\nAryl is an aromatic ring containing 6 or 10 carbon atoms. Examples of suitable aryl groups include phenyl and naphthyl, such as phenyl.\\n\\nUnless otherwise stated alkyl, alkoxy and haloalkyl groups containing the requisite number of carbon atoms can be branched or unbranched.

For example, a further feature is any of the embodiments described above with the proviso that any one or more of the compounds selected from the above list of examples of compounds of the specification are individually disclaimed.\\n\\nIn some embodiments, the compound is a compound of formula (I) excluding at least one compound recited in the Examples below. To illustrate, in some such embodiments, the compound is a compound of formula (I) excluding the compound disclosed in Example X, wherein X may be 1, 2,3, etc. In other embodiments, the compound is a compound of formula (I) excluding the compounds disclosed in Examples Y, wherein Y may be any combination of 1, 2,3, etc.\\n\\nThe compounds of general Formula I described in the present invention can be readily prepared according to the following reaction schemes. Furthermore, a skilled organic chemist will appreciate that where specific reaction conditions are used, it is understood that other suitable reaction conditions may be used to achieve the same transformation and are thus included in the present invention. It will also be clear to the skilled person that where synthetic schemes contain functionality which may interfere with the desired reaction, suitable protecting groups can be applied. For examples of protecting groups see T.W. Greene and P.G.M. Wuts, \"Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis\", Third Edition, John Wiley & Sons, New York, 1999.\\n\\nScheme 1Represents a general reaction scheme for preparing compounds of Formula (I), where R.sup.2 and R.sup.3 are defined as above, and where Z is defined below. An intermediate (IV) is condensed under standard amide bond forming conditions with intermediate (III). Conditions for this transformation include, but are not limited to the use of reagents such as EDC and HOBt, HATU and T3P and are conducted in solvents such as DCM, ethyl actetate or DMF in the presence of bases such as triethylamine, DMAP, diisopropyl ethylamine (DIPEA) or 2,6-lutidine. The intermediates (IV) and (III) and the reagents described are either commercially available or can be prepared using methods known to those skilled in the art.\\n\\n##STR00005##\\n\\nZ is either R.sup.1 which is defined as above, but excluding R.sup.1.dbd.H, leading directly to compounds of Formula (I), or it is a commonly used amine protecting group such as, but not limited to tert-butylcarbamate (Boc), 9-Fluorenylmethylcarbamate (Fmoc) or benzyl carbamate (Cbz), which is removed to give the amine (V), a special case of formula I where R.sup.1.dbd.H, either as a the free base or a salt, depending on the deprotection and isolation conditions (Scheme 2).\\n\\n##STR00006##\\n\\nAs shown in Scheme 3, amine (V) can then be transformed to an amide, a urea or a carbamate using standard organic chemistry procedures to give compounds of Formula (II). The reagents for these transformations such as, but not limited to, carboxylic acids, acid chlorides or anhydrides (R.sup.4CO.sub.2H, R.sup.4COCl, (R.sup.4CO).sub.2O), isocyanates (R.sup.13N.dbd.C.dbd.O) and chloroformates (R.sup.4\\'OCOCl) are either commercially available or can be prepared using methods known to those skilled in the art. For the avoidance of doubt, R.sup.4\\'O represents R.sup.4 as defined as above, wherein the final atom of the corresponding R.sup.4 is oxygen.\\n\\n##STR00007##\\n\\nAnother possibility is to use the functionality present in the R.sup.4 substituent of compounds of Formula (II) to transform it into other compounds of Formula (II). For some of these reactions, it might be advantageous to protect the hydroxy group with known protecting groups, such as, but not limited to, benzyl ethers. Scheme 4 shows an example of this approach.\\n\\n##STR00008##\\n\\nIntermediates such as (IV) are either commercially available or may be prepared by the method shown in Scheme 5 from anilines. Other methods for the preparation of intermediates (IV) can be found for example in: Cheng, J. F. et al. Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters 200636, 3484 or Nishimura, N. et al., Journal of Medicinal Chemistry 2014, 57, 3094.\\n\\n##STR00009##\\n\\nIntermediates (III) can be prepared by one of the general methods shown in the following Schemes. Introduction of the sulphur residue onto bromo lactam (VIII) can be conducted in several ways, by base-catalyzed or metal catalyzed substitution of the bromine with R.sup.2SH, where R.sup.2 is as defined above, but not NR.sup.5R.sup.6. This leads to thioethers (IX), which after protection of the lactam NH with a suitable protecting group, such as, but not limited to Boc, gives compounds (X), which can be subsequently oxidized to sulphones (XI) (Scheme 6). The order of the protection and oxidation step may be changed.\\n\\n##STR00010##\\n\\nAnother approach to thioethers (IX) is shown in Scheme 7. A thioether is formed from the bromo lactam as shown in Scheme 6, but the substituent on the sulphur is a protecting group, for example, but not limited to, benzyl or a methyl-propanoate group. Removal of the protecting group and alkylation of the resulting thiol then leads to thioethers (IX).\\n\\n##STR00011##\\n\\nFor R.sup.2.dbd.NR.sup.5R.sup.6 the route in Scheme 8 can be used. Benzyl thioether (XIV) is oxidized to the sulphonylchloride, which reacts with amines HNR.sup.5R.sup.6 to give sulphonamides (XVI). These can then be protected on the lactam nitrogen with a suitable protecting group, such as, but not limited to, Boc.\\n\\n##STR00012##\\n\\nFurther elaboration of these intermediate lactams to the isoindoline carboxylic acids (III) is shown in Scheme 9. Similar chemistry is described in Moran-Ramallal et al. Org. Lett. 2012, 14, 1696-1699. Reduction of protected lactams (XI) or (XVII) is followed by introduction of the cyano group, which is subsequently hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid. The resulting isoindoline (XX) is then protected at the nitrogen with a suitable protecting group such as, but not limited to Fmoc or Boc. Alternatively, the group R.sup.4CO can be introduced at this stage.\\n\\n##STR00013##\\n\\nScheme 10 shows a further possibility to access building blocks (III). Here, the R.sup.2-moiety is introduced after elaboration of the lactam to the carboxylic acid by alkylation of the thiol with electrophiles R.sup.2X, where X is a typical leaving group such as tosylate or halogen.\\n\\n##STR00014##\\n\\nIn Scheme 11, bromo lactam (VIII) is converted to intermediate (XXV), which is transformed to the advanced intermediate (XXVI). Subsequently, the bromine can be converted to a protected thiol derivative, as in (XXVII), or converted directly to precursor of the desired sulfone R.sup.2 and eventually to compounds of formula (II).\\n\\n##STR00015##\\n\\nCompounds of formula (I) contain a stereogenic center in the isoindoline moiety. Compounds of formula (I) can be separated into the (R)- and (S)-stereoisomers using appropriate chromatographic methods, as shown generically in Scheme 12 and described in the examples provided below. These stereoisomers can also be obtained by condensing intermediate (IV) under standard amide bond forming conditions with a chiral intermediate (III) as described in Scheme 1. Chiral intermediate III may be obtained from the corresponding unprotected chiral amino-acid using routine protection protocols known to those skilled in the art. The said unprotected chiral amino-acids are commercially available (for example from NetChem), or may be synthesised using procedures known to those skilled in the art. Where Z is a commonly used amine protecting group, such as those described for Scheme 2, then deprotection leads to the chiral amine (V), which can then react under conditions described for Scheme 3 to give compounds of formula (R)-II.\\n\\n##STR00016## ##STR00017##\\n\\nDetailed processes to the compounds of the specification are further described in the Examples below.\\n\\nCompounds and salts described in this specification generally may be used in methods to treat various disorders in animals, particularly mammals.

In this context, the combined amounts are \"therapeutically effective amounts\" if they are, when combined, sufficient to reduce or completely alleviate symptoms or other detrimental effects of the disorder; cure the disorder; reverse, completely stop, or slow the progress of the disorder; or reduce the risk of the disorder getting worse. Typically, such amounts may be determined by one skilled in the art by, for example, starting with the dosage range described in this specification for the compound or salt and an approved or otherwise published dosage range(s) of the other pharmaceutically active compound(s).\\n\\nIn order to use a compound of the specification, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, for the therapeutic treatment of a mammal, such as human, said ingredient is normally formulated in accordance with standard pharmaceutical practice as a pharmaceutical composition. Therefore in another aspect the present specification provides a pharmaceutical composition which comprises a compound of the formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof (active ingredient), and at least one pharmaceutically acceptable excipient.\\n\\nThe pharmaceutical composition is typically intended for use in the therapeutic and/or prophylactic treatment of a warm-blooded animal, such as man.\\n\\nTherefore the present specification provides a pharmaceutical composition that comprises a compound of the specification (or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof) and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients.\\n\\nBy the term \"pharmaceutically acceptable excipient\" we mean a substance that serves as a vehicle or medium for the compound of the specification (or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof), i.e. so as to prepare the active ingredient in a form suitable for administration. Generally the pharmaceutically acceptable excipients are pharmacologically inactive. Each excipient should be compatible with the other ingredients in the composition and should be acceptable for administration to a warm-blooded animal, such as man.\\n\\nThe excipient(s) selected for inclusion in a particular composition will depend on factors such as the mode of administration and the form of the composition provided.
